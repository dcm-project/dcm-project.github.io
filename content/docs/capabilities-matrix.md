# DCM — Foundational Capabilities Matrix

> **Purpose:** This document defines the core operational capabilities required for DCM to perform lifecycle management as defined by the data model. Each capability maps to a consumer/service provider perspective and will be used to drive implementation work in Jira.
>
> **How to read this document:**
> - **Capability Domain** — the architectural area the capability belongs to
> - **Capability** — a discrete operational function; the smallest unit of independently implementable behavior
> - **Consumer perspective** — what the end user / application team experiences
> - **Service Provider perspective** — what the Service Provider or platform component must implement
> - **Platform/Admin perspective** — what the platform engineer or SRE must configure or operate
> - **Depends on** — other capabilities that must exist first

## Dependency Map — Critical Path Capabilities

These capabilities block the most downstream work and should be implemented first:

```
IAM-001 (Actor Authentication)
  └── IAM-002 (Session Tokens) → IAM-003 (RBAC) → IAM-007 (Tenant Scope)
        └── CAT-001 (Service Catalog)
              └── REQ-001 (Submit Request)
                    └── REQ-002 (Intent State) → REQ-003 (Layer Assembly)
                          └── REQ-004 (Policy Evaluation) → REQ-005 (Placement)
                                └── REQ-007 (Provider Dispatch)
                                      └── PRV-003 (Realization) → PRV-005 (Realized State)
                                            └── LCM-001 (State Transitions)
                                                  └── DRF-001 (Discovery) → DRF-002 (Drift)

PRV-001 (Provider Registration) — parallel critical path
  └── PRV-002 (Naturalization) → PRV-003 (Realization)
  └── PRV-006 (Capacity Reporting) → REQ-005 (Placement)
```

**Minimum viable DCM capability set (to demonstrate end-to-end lifecycle):**

IAM-001 → IAM-002 → IAM-003 → IAM-007 → CAT-001 → REQ-001 → REQ-002 → REQ-003 → REQ-004 → REQ-005 → REQ-006 → REQ-007 → PRV-001 → PRV-002 → PRV-003 → PRV-004 → PRV-005 → LCM-001 → DRF-001 → DRF-002 → AUD-001

**21 capabilities for a functional end-to-end demonstration.**

**Note:** FCM-001 through FCM-007 (Federated Contribution Model) are not on the critical path — they extend DCM's multi-user capabilities but are not required for the initial end-to-end lifecycle demonstration.
