# DCM Data Model — Event Catalog

**Document Status:** ✅ Complete
**Document Type:** Architecture Reference — Authoritative Event Catalog
**Related Documents:** [Notification Model](23-notification-model.md) | [Webhooks and Messaging](18-webhooks-messaging.md) | [Universal Audit](16-universal-audit.md) | [Credential Provider Model](31-credential-provider-model.md) | [Authority Tier Model](32-authority-tier-model.md) | [Control Plane Components](25-control-plane-components.md)

> **This is the single authoritative source for all DCM event types.**
>
> The Notification Model (doc 23) defines delivery pipeline, audience resolution, and urgency routing. The Webhooks doc (doc 18) defines the Message Bus integration. This document defines **what events exist, when they fire, and what their payloads contain**. Any document referencing an event type is authoritative only if it agrees with this catalog. Conflicts resolve in favor of this document.

> **Implementation note:** Consumers (webhook receivers, Notification Providers, Message Bus subscribers, audit tooling) must implement idempotency using `event_uuid`. Events are delivered at-least-once. Per-entity ordering is guaranteed; cross-entity ordering is not.

## 1. Base Envelope

Every DCM event shares a common envelope. Event-specific fields are in the `payload` object.

```yaml
# DCM Event Envelope — all events
event_uuid: <uuid>                  # idempotency key; stable across retries
event_type: <string>                # fully qualified: domain.event_name
event_schema_version: "1.0"         # increments on breaking payload changes
timestamp: <ISO 8601>               # from Commit Log — authoritative source of truth
dcm_version: <semver>               # DCM instance version that generated the event
dcm_instance_uuid: <uuid>           # identifies the DCM instance (federation context)

subject:
  entity_uuid: <uuid | null>        # primary entity this event concerns
  entity_type: <string | null>      # entity type FQN (e.g. Compute.VirtualMachine)
  entity_handle: <string | null>    # human-readable identifier
  tenant_uuid: <uuid | null>        # tenant scope; null for system-scope events
  actor_uuid: <uuid | null>         # actor who triggered the event; null for system events

urgency: critical | high | medium | low | info   # governs notification routing

payload: {}                         # event-specific fields — see Section 3+

links:
  self: <url>                       # DCM API URL for the subject entity or record
  audit_record: <url>               # DCM API URL for the audit record for this event
```

### 1.1 Urgency Levels

| Urgency | Meaning | Delivery expectation |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| `critical` | Security or compliance event requiring immediate action | Push notification; page if configured |
| `high` | Significant operational event; action likely required | Push notification |
| `medium` | Notable event; review recommended | Standard delivery |
| `low` | Informational; action unlikely required | Standard delivery |
| `info` | Observational; no action expected | Batch or webhook only |

### 1.2 Schema Versioning

`event_schema_version` increments when breaking changes occur to the `payload` schema for an event type. Consumers should validate against the declared version. Non-breaking additions (new optional fields) do not increment the version.

## 18. System Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `EVT-001` | Every event must include the base envelope fields (`event_uuid`, `event_type`, `event_schema_version`, `timestamp`, `dcm_version`, `dcm_instance_uuid`, `urgency`). Events omitting required envelope fields are invalid and must not be published. |
| `EVT-002` | `event_uuid` is the idempotency key. Consumers must treat duplicate `event_uuid` values as already-processed. DCM may re-deliver events on failure; this is not a bug. |
| `EVT-003` | `timestamp` is sourced from the Commit Log Stage 1 write. It represents when the event was authoritatively recorded, not when it was delivered. |
| `EVT-004` | `event_schema_version` must increment on any breaking change to a payload schema. Adding optional fields is not a breaking change. Removing fields, changing field types, or changing field semantics are breaking changes. |
| `EVT-005` | Events with `urgency: critical` must be delivered via the push channel if the Notification Provider supports it, regardless of consumer subscription preferences. |
| `EVT-006` | This catalog is the authoritative source for event type names. Any event type not in this catalog is non-standard. Non-standard events may be published by providers or extensions but must use a reverse-DNS prefix (e.g. `com.acme.custom_event`). |
| `EVT-007` | The `audit.*` events with `urgency: critical` are non-suppressable. They are delivered regardless of audience subscription rules and cannot be filtered by consumer preference. |
