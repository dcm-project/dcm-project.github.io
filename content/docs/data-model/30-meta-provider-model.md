DCM's standard machinery (Placement Engine, Orchestration Flow Policy, Recovery Policy) handles everything beyond registration and constituent execution. The Meta Provider is not an orchestrator — it is a compound service definition plus a set of standard Service Providers that happen to serve multiple resource types within the same system.

## 1. What a Meta Provider Is

### 1.1 The Core Model

A Meta Provider is a **compound Service Provider** that uses other providers in the DCM catalog to fulfill a higher-order service request. Its defining characteristic is that it registers a **compound service definition** — a declaration of constituent resource types, their dependencies, and their delivery requirements — so that DCM has enough information to:

1. **Select appropriate constituent providers** via the standard Placement Engine
2. **Determine execution order** from the dependency graph
3. **Govern rehydration sequence** using the same dependency information

Beyond providing that definition, a Meta Provider operates as a standard Service Provider for each constituent resource type it owns. DCM's standard machinery handles everything else: placement, sequencing, failure handling, compensation, and audit.

**A Meta Provider is not an orchestrator.** It does not:
- Select constituent providers — the Placement Engine does this
- Sequence execution rounds — the dependency graph informs DCM's Orchestration Flow Policy
- Manage parallel execution — parallelism is derived from the dependency graph (resources with no unresolved dependencies execute simultaneously)
- Run compensation — DCM's Recovery Policy executes compensation using the dependency graph in reverse
- Make routing decisions — these are DCM policy decisions

### 1.2 Why This Model Is Correct

Every DCM design principle is preserved:
- **Governance stays with DCM** — constituent provider selection goes through the Placement Engine, including sovereignty filtering, accreditation checking, and trust scoring
- **Policy stays with DCM** — GateKeeper, Validation, and Transformation policies fire on the compound payload; the same policies govern each constituent sub-request
- **Audit stays with DCM** — each constituent request is a standard DCM request with its own audit trail; the compound audit is assembled from constituent audit records
- **Recovery stays with DCM** — the Recovery Policy handles constituent failures using the dependency graph; the Meta Provider does not make recovery decisions

### 1.3 The Practical Meaning

A Meta Provider registration tells DCM: "Here is a compound service called `ApplicationStack.WebApp`. To fulfill it, you will need a `Compute.VirtualMachine`, a `Network.IPAddress`, a `DNS.Record` (which depends on both), and a `Network.LoadBalancer` (which also depends on both). I can provide the DNS and LoadBalancer; you should place the VM and IP with appropriate compute and network providers."

DCM then:
- Creates a Composite Entity with one entity UUID
- Runs the compound layer assembly to produce the full payload
- Applies policies to the compound payload
- Dispatches constituent sub-requests to the appropriate providers (compute provider for VM, network provider for IP, Meta Provider for DNS and LoadBalancer)
- Sequences those sub-requests based on the declared dependency graph
- Handles any constituent failures using Recovery Policy
- Assembles the aggregate Realized State from all constituent realized states

The Meta Provider's execution responsibility is limited to: naturalizing and realizing the constituent resource types it owns, then denaturalizing and returning the realized state — exactly as a standard Service Provider does.

---

## 2. Compound Service Definition

The compound service definition is the Meta Provider's primary contribution to DCM. It is declared at registration and stored in the Resource Type Registry as a compound Resource Type Specification.

### 2.1 Constituent Declaration

```yaml
resource_types_composed:
  - fqn: ApplicationStack.WebApp
    version: "2.0.0"

    constituents:
      - component_id: vm-primary
        resource_type: Compute.VirtualMachine
        provided_by: external    # DCM places this with an appropriate compute provider
        depends_on: []
        required_for_delivery: required

      - component_id: ip-primary
        resource_type: Network.IPAddress
        provided_by: external    # DCM places this with an appropriate network provider
        depends_on: []
        required_for_delivery: required

      - component_id: dns-primary
        resource_type: DNS.Record
        provided_by: self        # This Meta Provider handles DNS
        depends_on: [vm-primary, ip-primary]
        required_for_delivery: partial

      - component_id: lb-frontend
        resource_type: Network.LoadBalancer
        provided_by: self        # This Meta Provider handles LoadBalancer
        depends_on: [vm-primary, ip-primary]
        required_for_delivery: partial

    composition_visibility: selective   # opaque | transparent | selective
    dcm_visible_sub_resources:
      - resource_type: Compute.VirtualMachine
        role: application_host
      - resource_type: Network.LoadBalancer
        role: ingress_endpoint
```

### 2.2 provided_by Declaration

`provided_by` is the key field that tells DCM who is responsible for each constituent:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `self` | This Meta Provider handles this constituent. DCM dispatches it to the Meta Provider. |
| `external` | DCM places this constituent with the best available provider via the standard Placement Engine. |
| `<provider_uuid>` | DCM dispatches this constituent to a specific named provider. |

For `external` constituents, DCM runs a full placement cycle — sovereignty filtering, accreditation checking, trust scoring, reserve query — exactly as it would for any standalone request.

For `self` constituents, DCM dispatches to the Meta Provider using the standard Services API. The Meta Provider receives a standard constituent payload and responds with a standard realized state — no special handling required.

### 2.3 Dependency Graph

The `depends_on` list is the mechanism by which the Meta Provider informs DCM of execution ordering. DCM reads this graph and:

- Identifies which constituents have no dependencies → dispatches these first (or simultaneously)
- Identifies which constituents have dependencies on already-realized constituents → dispatches these when their dependencies are complete
- Derives parallelism directly from the graph — constituents with no shared unresolved dependencies execute concurrently within DCM's standard pipeline

**The Meta Provider does not manage this sequencing.** It declares the graph. DCM executes it.

```
depends_on: []                          → eligible for immediate dispatch
depends_on: [vm-primary]                → dispatched after vm-primary is REALIZED
depends_on: [vm-primary, ip-primary]    → dispatched after BOTH are REALIZED
```

### 2.4 required_for_delivery Classification

Each constituent declares how its success or failure affects the compound service:

| Classification | Failure effect |
|----------------|---------------|
| `required` | DCM halts the compound request; triggers Recovery Policy; unrealized constituents are not dispatched |
| `partial` | DCM notes the failure; compound service continues; final status may be `DEGRADED` |
| `optional` | DCM notes the failure; compound service continues unaffected |

The Recovery Policy governs what happens on `required` constituent failure — the same Recovery Policy that governs any request failure. No special Meta Provider recovery logic exists.

---

## 3. Composite Entity — Four-State Representation

A compound service request produces a **Composite Entity** — a single DCM entity that aggregates constituent sub-entities. The Composite Entity has one entity UUID that links it across all four states.

### 3.1 Intent State

The consumer submits one request against the compound catalog item. The intent payload contains consumer-declared fields for the compound service — not individual constituent fields.

```yaml
entity_uuid: <uuid>          # assigned at intent creation; stable across all states
catalog_item_uuid: <uuid>    # ApplicationStack.WebApp
fields:
  app_name: payments-api
  environment: production
  region: EU-WEST
  cpu_count: 4
  memory_gb: 16
  dns_hostname: payments-api.internal.corp.example
```

DCM does not expand this into constituent requests at Intent State. The intent is stored as-is.

### 3.2 Requested State

The Request Payload Processor expands the compound intent into the full constituent payload. This is where the compound service definition from the Meta Provider registration is applied.

```yaml
entity_uuid: <uuid>
composite_entity: true
meta_provider_uuid: <uuid>

top_level:
  app_name: payments-api
  environment: production
  region: EU-WEST

constituents:
  - component_id: vm-primary
    resource_type: Compute.VirtualMachine
    provided_by: external
    provider_uuid: null        # resolved by Placement Engine
    fields:
      cpu_count: 4
      memory_gb: 16
      os_family: rhel
    depends_on: []
    required_for_delivery: required

  - component_id: ip-primary
    resource_type: Network.IPAddress
    provided_by: external
    provider_uuid: null        # resolved by Placement Engine
    fields:
      ip_version: 4
      allocation_pool: prod-EU-WEST
    depends_on: []
    required_for_delivery: required

  - component_id: dns-primary
    resource_type: DNS.Record
    provided_by: self
    provider_uuid: <meta_provider_uuid>
    fields:
      hostname: payments-api.internal.corp.example
      record_type: A
    depends_on: [vm-primary, ip-primary]
    required_for_delivery: partial

  - component_id: lb-frontend
    resource_type: Network.LoadBalancer
    provided_by: self
    provider_uuid: <meta_provider_uuid>
    fields:
      backend_component: vm-primary
    depends_on: [vm-primary, ip-primary]
    required_for_delivery: partial
```

### 3.3 Realized State

The Realized State is assembled by DCM from the constituent realized payloads returned by each dispatched provider. DCM writes it as a unified composite record.

```yaml
entity_uuid: <uuid>
composite_entity: true
composite_status: DEGRADED    # REALIZED | DEGRADED | FAILED

composite_fields:             # synthesized consumer-facing view
  primary_ip: 10.1.45.23
  vm_id: vm-0a1b2c3d
  lb_endpoint: lb-7f8e9d.eu-west.corp
  dns_name: null              # absent — dns constituent failed

constituents_realized:
  - component_id: vm-primary
    status: REALIZED
    provider_uuid: <compute_provider_uuid>
    realized_fields:
      vm_id: vm-0a1b2c3d
      hypervisor_host: host-eu-w-04
    required_for_delivery: required

  - component_id: ip-primary
    status: REALIZED
    provider_uuid: <network_provider_uuid>
    realized_fields:
      assigned_ip: 10.1.45.23
    required_for_delivery: required

  - component_id: dns-primary
    status: FAILED
    provider_uuid: <meta_provider_uuid>
    failure_reason: "DNS service degraded — record not created"
    required_for_delivery: partial

  - component_id: lb-frontend
    status: REALIZED
    provider_uuid: <meta_provider_uuid>
    realized_fields:
      lb_id: lb-7f8e9d
      endpoint: lb-7f8e9d.eu-west.corp
    required_for_delivery: partial

degradation_summary:
  - component_id: dns-primary
    impact: "DNS name resolution unavailable — access via IP only"
    recovery_eligible: true
```

### 3.4 Discovered State

Discovery for composite entities follows the composition visibility mode:

- `opaque` — DCM schedules one discovery call to the Meta Provider; it returns the compound discovered state as a single payload
- `transparent` — DCM schedules independent discovery calls to each constituent's provider; drift detection runs on each constituent independently
- `selective` — DCM schedules discovery calls for DCM-visible constituents; opaque discovery for the rest via Meta Provider

---

## 4. What DCM Does vs What the Meta Provider Does

This table is the definitive statement of responsibility.

| Concern | DCM | Meta Provider |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Compound catalog item presentation | ✅ — Service Catalog manages the compound item | Declares the compound service definition at registration |
| Consumer-facing API | ✅ — Consumer API handles compound requests identically to simple requests | — |
| Layer assembly | ✅ — Request Payload Processor assembles constituent blocks from compound service definition | — |
| Policy evaluation on compound payload | ✅ — Same Policy Engine, same policies, same scoring model | May contribute provider-domain policies for its own constituents |
| External constituent placement | ✅ — Placement Engine selects provider for each `provided_by: external` constituent | Declares what resource types each constituent needs so placement can filter appropriately |
| Self constituent dispatch | ✅ — API Gateway dispatches to Meta Provider using standard Services API | Receives constituent payload; naturalizes; executes; denaturalizes; returns realized state |
| Execution ordering from dependency graph | ✅ — Derived from `depends_on` declarations; DCM dispatches in order | Declares `depends_on` relationships for each constituent |
| Parallelism | ✅ — Constituents with no unresolved dependencies execute concurrently within DCM's pipeline | Emerges from the dependency graph declaration; Meta Provider does not manage this |
| Constituent failure handling | ✅ — Recovery Policy fires based on `required_for_delivery` classification | Declares `required_for_delivery` for each constituent |
| Compensation (teardown of realized constituents on failure) | ✅ — Recovery Policy executes compensation using dependency graph in reverse | Implements standard decommission handling for `self` constituents |
| Composite status determination | ✅ — Determined by DCM from constituent outcomes and `required_for_delivery` | — |
| Realized State assembly | ✅ — DCM assembles composite Realized State from constituent realized payloads | Returns standard realized payload for `self` constituents |
| Drift detection | ✅ — Standard drift detection per composition visibility mode | Implements standard discovery endpoint for `self` constituents |
| Lifecycle management of Composite Entity | ✅ — Standard DCM entity lifecycle | Handles decommission of `self` constituents when decommission payload received |
| Audit trail | ✅ — Each constituent request has its own audit record; composite audit assembled by DCM | — |

### 4.1 The Meta Provider's Execution Scope Is Narrow

For each `self` constituent, the Meta Provider:
1. Receives a standard DCM constituent payload (already fully assembled by DCM)
2. Naturalizes it to its native format
3. Executes the realization
4. Denaturalizes the result
5. Returns a standard realized payload

This is identical to what any Service Provider does. The Meta Provider is not special during execution — it is simply a Service Provider that happens to be registered for multiple resource types within the same underlying system.

---

## 5. Composition Visibility

Introduced in [07-service-dependencies.md](07-service-dependencies.md), this section specifies the operational implications.

| Mode | Consumer sees | DCM manages independently | Drift detection |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| `opaque` | Top-level entity only | Composite entity only | Via Meta Provider discovery endpoint |
| `transparent` | All constituents as DCM entities | All constituent entities individually | Per-constituent via each provider |
| `selective` | Declared visible constituents | Declared visible constituents | Per-constituent for visible; via Meta Provider for rest |

### 5.1 Transparent Mode Entity UUIDs

In transparent mode, constituent entities receive stable DCM entity UUIDs:
```
constituent_entity_uuid = deterministic_uuid(parent_entity_uuid + component_id)
```

These UUIDs are stable across rehydration — the same compound entity always produces the same constituent UUIDs. This enables consistent audit trail linkage.

### 5.2 Decommission Cascade

When a composite entity is decommissioned:
- DCM dispatches constituent decommission sub-requests in dependency-reverse order
- Each constituent's provider (whether `self` or `external`) receives a standard decommission payload
- The composite entity's lifecycle state transitions to DECOMMISSIONED only after all constituents confirm decommission

---

## 6. Rehydration

Rehydration of a composite entity is the primary use case for the dependency graph declaration — which the Meta Provider provides precisely for this purpose.

### 6.1 Rehydration Sequence

DCM reads the `depends_on` graph and rehydrates constituents in dependency order:

```
Round 1: components with depends_on: []          → rehydrate first
Round 2: components whose depends_on are realized → rehydrate next
Round N: continue until all constituents complete
```

The Meta Provider's dependency declarations give DCM exactly the information it needs to sequence rehydration correctly without requiring any special Meta Provider involvement beyond standard constituent execution.

### 6.2 Rehydration Provider Selection

`provided_by: external` constituents are re-placed by the Placement Engine during rehydration — they may end up on a different provider than the original realization if the original provider is no longer eligible. `provided_by: self` constituents always return to the same Meta Provider.

---

## 7. Compound Request Pipeline

A compound service request flows through DCM's standard pipeline with compound-specific extensions at the Request Payload Processor step.

```
Consumer submits compound request
  │
  ▼ Intent State captured (compound intent, no constituent expansion)
  │
  ▼ Request Payload Processor:
  │   Layer assembly on compound payload
  │   Expansion: compound service definition → constituent blocks
  │     (resource_type, provided_by, fields, depends_on, required_for_delivery per constituent)
  │   Policy evaluation on compound payload (GateKeeper, Validation, Transformation, scoring)
  │   Placement: external constituents → Placement Engine
  │             self constituents     → Meta Provider
  │
  ▼ Requested State written (full constituent specification with provider assignments)
  │
  ▼ Constituent dispatch — dependency-ordered by DCM:
  │   Round 1 (no dependencies): dispatch vm-primary, ip-primary in parallel
  │     vm-primary → compute_provider (standard Services API)
  │     ip-primary → network_provider (standard Services API)
  │
  │   Round 2 (vm+ip REALIZED): dispatch dns-primary, lb-frontend in parallel
  │     dns-primary → meta_provider (standard Services API)
  │     lb-frontend → meta_provider (standard Services API)
  │
  │   Any constituent FAILS:
  │     required  → Recovery Policy fires; unstarted constituents cancelled
  │     partial   → noted as degraded; execution continues
  │     optional  → noted; execution continues
  │
  ▼ Constituent realized payloads collected by DCM
  │
  ▼ Composite status determined: REALIZED | DEGRADED | FAILED
  │
  ▼ Realized State written (composite record assembled by DCM)
  │
  ▼ Consumer notified of compound request outcome
```

---

## 8. Nested Meta Providers

A Meta Provider may declare a constituent with `provided_by: external` where the appropriate provider is itself another Meta Provider. DCM's Placement Engine handles this transparently — it places the constituent with whichever registered provider best satisfies the constraints, whether that is a simple Service Provider or another Meta Provider.

**Maximum nesting depth: 3** — enforced by DCM at placement time by checking the compound service definition chain depth. Deeper nesting creates dependency graph complexity that exceeds DCM's governance model.

**The nested Meta Provider has no special awareness** that it is being called as a constituent of an outer compound service. It receives a standard constituent payload and responds with a standard realized state. Nesting is a DCM-level concept, not a provider-level one.

---

## 9. Scoring Model Integration

Compound service requests are scored using the standard five-signal model with two compound-specific behaviors:

**Operational GateKeepers** fire on the compound payload assembled from the top-level fields and declared constituent types. They do not fire per-constituent (constituent-level policy evaluation happens in each constituent sub-request's own pipeline).

**Provider accreditation richness (Signal 5)** for compound entities uses the lowest richness score among all `required_for_delivery: required` constituents across all their assigned providers. The compound service is only as well-accredited as its least-accredited required constituent.

---

## 10. Meta Provider Registration Contract

```yaml
meta_provider_capabilities:
  # Resource types this Meta Provider handles as a self provider
  resource_types_provided:
    - DNS.Record
    - Network.LoadBalancer

  # Compound service definitions this Meta Provider offers
  resource_types_composed:
    - fqn: ApplicationStack.WebApp
      version: "2.0.0"
      constituents:
        - component_id: vm-primary
          resource_type: Compute.VirtualMachine
          provided_by: external
          depends_on: []
          required_for_delivery: required
        - component_id: ip-primary
          resource_type: Network.IPAddress
          provided_by: external
          depends_on: []
          required_for_delivery: required
        - component_id: dns-primary
          resource_type: DNS.Record
          provided_by: self
          depends_on: [vm-primary, ip-primary]
          required_for_delivery: partial
        - component_id: lb-frontend
          resource_type: Network.LoadBalancer
          provided_by: self
          depends_on: [vm-primary, ip-primary]
          required_for_delivery: partial
      composition_visibility: selective
      dcm_visible_sub_resources:
        - resource_type: Compute.VirtualMachine
          role: application_host
        - resource_type: Network.LoadBalancer
          role: ingress_endpoint

  # Standard provider declarations apply as for any Service Provider
  # (sovereignty, accreditations, capacity reporting, health check, etc.)
```

---

## 11. System Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `MPX-001` | A Meta Provider's `self` constituents are dispatched using the standard Services API. The Meta Provider receives a standard constituent payload and returns a standard realized state. No special dispatch protocol exists for Meta Provider self-constituents. |
| `MPX-002` | Constituent execution ordering is derived from the `depends_on` declaration by DCM. The Meta Provider does not sequence constituent dispatch. |
| `MPX-003` | Parallelism in constituent execution is derived from the dependency graph. Constituents with no unresolved dependencies execute concurrently within DCM's standard pipeline. The Meta Provider does not manage this. |
| `MPX-004` | Composite status determination (`REALIZED` / `DEGRADED` / `FAILED`) is performed by DCM based on constituent outcomes and `required_for_delivery` classifications. |
| `MPX-005` | Recovery Policy governs all constituent failure handling and compensation. The Meta Provider does not make recovery decisions. It implements standard decommission handling for `self` constituents when a decommission payload arrives. |
| `MPX-006` | `provided_by: external` constituents are placed by the Placement Engine using standard placement rules. The Meta Provider does not influence external constituent provider selection. |
| `MPX-007` | In transparent composition visibility mode, constituent entity UUIDs are `deterministic_uuid(parent_entity_uuid + component_id)` — stable across rehydration. |
| `MPX-008` | Maximum Meta Provider nesting depth is 3, enforced by DCM at placement time by checking the compound service definition chain depth. |
