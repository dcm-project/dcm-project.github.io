# DCM Taxonomy

The DCM taxonomy defines the precise vocabulary used throughout the architecture. Every term used in the data model, specifications, and implementation should conform to these definitions.

**Purpose:** Eliminate ambiguity. When two people use the same word to mean different things, architecture breaks down. This taxonomy prevents that.

---

## Part 1 — Core Vocabulary

### The Three Foundational Abstractions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Data** | Any structured artifact in DCM with a type, UUID, lifecycle state, fields, data classification, and provenance. Everything that exists, is stored, and has a lifecycle. Entities, layers, policies, accreditations, audit records, groups, relationships — all Data. |
| **Provider** | Any external component DCM calls or that calls DCM. Implements the unified Provider base contract (registration, health, sovereignty, accreditation, governance matrix enforcement, zero trust). What varies between provider types is the capability extension. |
| **Policy** | A rule artifact that fires when Data matches declared conditions, produces a typed output (decision, mutation, action, or directive), and is enforced at a declared level. Policies govern every transition, transformation, and constraint in DCM. |

### Provider Types (11)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Service Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: realize infrastructure resources. Implements naturalization, realization, denaturalization, and discovery. |
| **Information Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: serve authoritative external data (CMDB, HR, Finance, identity). |
| **Storage Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: persist DCM state. Sub-types: GitOps, write-once snapshot, event stream, search index, audit. |
| **Meta Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: compose multiple child providers into a compound service delivered as a single catalog item. |
| **Policy Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: evaluate policies externally. Modes 1–4; Mode 3–4 for OPA/Rego sidecar and black-box query enrichment. |
| **Credential Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: issue, rotate, and revoke secrets and credentials. |
| **Auth Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: authenticate actor identities and resolve role/group memberships. |
| **Notification Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: deliver notification envelopes to configured channels (Slack, PagerDuty, email, webhook). |
| **Message Bus Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: async event streaming between DCM and external systems. |
| **Registry Provider** | Typed Provider. Capability: serve the Resource Type Registry (core, community, organization tiers). |
| **Peer DCM** | Typed Provider. Another DCM instance participating in federation. Federation is the Provider abstraction applied across DCM instances. |

### Policy Types (7)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **GateKeeper Policy** | Typed Policy. Declares `enforcement_class: compliance` (boolean deny — halts request) or `operational` (contributes `risk_score_contribution` to request risk score). Compliance-class is the default and fail-safe. See [Scoring Model](data-model/scoring-model/). |
| **Validation Policy** | Typed Policy. Declares `output_class: structural` (boolean pass/fail — halts on fail) or `advisory` (contributes completeness score + warning list without blocking). Structural is the default and fail-safe. See [Scoring Model](data-model/scoring-model/). |
| **Transformation Policy** | Typed Policy. Output: mutations[] — field additions, changes, locks. Fires on request payload. All mutations collected and applied with provenance. |
| **Recovery Policy** | Typed Policy. Output: action + parameters. Fires on failure/timeout trigger conditions. Governs what DCM does when things go wrong. |
| **Orchestration Flow Policy** | Typed Policy. Output: ordered step sequence. Fires on pipeline payload type events. Named workflow artifacts — the explicit, visible pipeline skeleton. |
| **Governance Matrix Rule** | Typed Policy. Output: ALLOW / DENY / ALLOW_WITH_CONDITIONS / STRIP_FIELD / REDACT / AUDIT_ONLY. Fires at every cross-boundary interaction. The single enforcement point for all data/capability boundary decisions. |
| **Lifecycle Policy** | Typed Policy. Output: action on related entity (cascade, protect, detach, notify). Fires on relationship events. |

### Data Model Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Entity** | A Resource Entity, Process Entity, or Composite Entity — the primary managed thing in DCM. Has a UUID that is stable across all four lifecycle states. |
| **Four States** | Intent (consumer declaration), Requested (assembled/policy-validated), Realized (provider-confirmed), Discovered (independently observed). Same entity at four lifecycle stages in four specialized stores. |
| **Data Layer** | A versioned data artifact that contributes fields to request payload assembly. Types: Base, Core, Intermediate, Service, Request. Each has a declared contributor type. |
| **Resource Type Specification** | The schema definition for a resource type. Declares fields, constraints, portability class, dependency graph, and field criticality. |
| **Provider Catalog Item** | A provider-specific instantiation of a Resource Type Specification. What consumers actually request from the service catalog. |
| **Artifact Metadata** | Standard metadata block on every DCM artifact: uuid, handle, version, status, owned_by, created_by, contributed_by. |
| **Provenance** | Field-level lineage metadata embedded in every payload field, recording origin and all modifications. |
| **Data Classification** | Field-level metadata: public / internal / confidential / restricted / phi / pci / sovereign / classified. Phi, sovereign, and classified are immutable once set. |
| **Sovereignty Zone** | A registered DCM artifact declaring a geopolitical/regulatory boundary. Rules reference zones by ID, not raw country codes. |
| **Accreditation** | A formal, versioned, time-bounded attestation that a DCM component satisfies a specific compliance framework. First-class Data artifact with its own lifecycle. |
| **DCMGroup** | Universal grouping artifact with typed group_class: tenant_boundary, resource_grouping, policy_collection, policy_profile, composite, federation. |
| **Drift Record** | A Data artifact produced by the Drift Reconciliation Component recording field-by-field comparison of Realized vs Discovered state with severity classification. |
| **Governance Matrix Rule** | A Data artifact (also a Policy type) — a rule artifact governing cross-boundary interactions using four-axis match conditions. |

### Operational Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Request Orchestrator** | The event bus. Routes lifecycle events to the Policy Engine. Contains no pipeline logic — Policies define all behavior. |
| **Policy Engine** | Evaluates all policy types using the same algorithm. The single policy evaluator — no component bypasses it. |
| **Placement Engine** | Six-step provider selection: sovereignty filter → accreditation filter → capability filter → parallel reserve queries → tie-breaking (policy/priority/affinity/cost/load/hash) → confirm. |
| **Drift Reconciliation** | Control plane component. Compares Discovered State vs Realized State. Produces drift records and events. Never writes to the Realized Store. |
| **Shadow Mode** | A Policy in `proposed` status evaluates against real traffic; output is captured but never applied. The primary mechanism for safe policy change management. |
| **Naturalization** | Service Provider converts a DCM unified payload to provider-native format before execution. |
| **Denaturalization** | Service Provider converts provider-native result back to DCM unified format after execution. |
| **Rehydration** | Replaying a resource's intent state to a new provider or context. Produces a new Requested State from the existing Intent State. |
| **Contributor** | An actor type that authored a Data artifact. Recorded in artifact_metadata.contributed_by. Types: platform_admin, consumer, service_provider, peer_dcm. Determines review requirements. |
| **Two-Level Orchestration** | Level 1: Named Workflow Artifacts (Orchestration Flow Policy, ordered: true) — explicit sequence skeleton. Level 2: Dynamic Policies (GateKeeper, Transformation, Recovery) — fire conditionally on same events without being declared in the workflow. |
| **Reserve Query** | A parallel capacity query sent to all eligible provider candidates. Providers confirm capacity and hold it for PT5M. The Placement Engine selects the winner and releases other holds. |




### Credential Provider Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Credential Record** | DCM Data artifact storing credential metadata (UUID, type, scope, expiry, status). Never contains the credential value — values are held by the Credential Provider. |
| **DCM Interaction Credential** | Short-lived (PT15M–PT1H profile-governed), scoped credential issued before every provider dispatch. Implements ZTS-002. Never stored beyond the interaction window. |
| **Credential Revocation Registry** | Fast-queryable store of revoked credential UUIDs. All components that receive interaction credentials must check this registry at each use. Cache TTL: PT1M standard; PT30S fsi/sovereign. |
| **Transition Window** | Period during rotation when both the old and new credential are valid. Prevents downtime. P1D for consumer credentials; PT5M for dcm_interaction; P7D for x509. |
| **Emergency Rotation** | Rotation triggered by a security event. No transition window — old credential revoked immediately. Fastest-channel notification delivery. |
| **CPX-001–CPX-012** | Credential Provider system policies. Key: CPX-001 (values never in DCM stores — every profile), CPX-002 (every dispatch must present scoped interaction credential), CPX-009 (algorithm and key_usage declared at issuance; validated at use), CPX-012 (CPX-001 applies in ALL profiles — no exceptions). |
| **credential_profile** | Profile-governed credential configuration block controlling: permitted credential types, max lifetime per type, rotation requirements, retrieval auth level (bearer/step-up-mfa/mtls), FIPS level enforcement, approved algorithms, revocation SLA, idle detection threshold, IP binding requirement. |
| **AAL (Authenticator Assurance Level)** | NIST 800-63B vocabulary: AAL1 (minimal/dev — single factor), AAL2 (standard/prod — MFA required for sensitive credentials), AAL2+ (fsi — hardware MFA, FIPS L2), AAL3 (sovereign — hardware-bound, FIPS L3, tamper evidence). |
| **Idle Credential** | A credential issued but not retrieved within the profile-governed threshold. Triggers notification but not automatic revocation. Auto-revocation after 2× threshold is profile-configurable. |
| **key_usage** | Declared purpose of a credential: authentication, signing, or encryption. Non-overlapping — a credential issued for authentication cannot be used for signing even if the algorithm supports both. Validated at use time by Credential Provider. |


### Meta Provider Composability Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Composite Entity** | A DCM entity produced by a Meta Provider. Exists across all four states as a single entity aggregating constituent Resource Entities. Has one entity UUID that links it through all states. |
| **Constituent** | A sub-resource within a compound service that a Meta Provider provisions. Declared with a `component_id`, `resource_type`, `depends_on`, and `required_for_delivery` classification. |
| **required_for_delivery** | Constituent delivery classification: `required` (failure halts the compound service and triggers compensation), `partial` (failure produces DEGRADED but not FAILED), `optional` (failure is noted but ignored). |
| **Composite Status** | Top-level outcome of a compound service execution: `REALIZED` (all required constituents succeeded), `DEGRADED` (required succeeded; partial(s) failed; accepted if profile permits), `FAILED` (required constituent(s) failed; triggers compensation). |
| **Compensation** | Ordered teardown of successfully realized constituents when a compound service cannot be delivered. Runs in dependency-reverse order. Best-effort; failures produce `PARTIALLY_COMPENSATED` with orphan detection. |
| **Composition Visibility** | How a Meta Provider exposes its internal structure to DCM: `opaque` (top-level only), `transparent` (all constituents as DCM entities), `selective` (declared sub-set as DCM entities). |
| **Dependency Round** | A batch of constituents that can execute in parallel because all their `depends_on` constituents are complete. Multiple rounds execute sequentially; constituents within a round execute in parallel. |
| **MPX-001–MPX-008** | Meta Provider system policies. Key: MPX-001 (compensation required if partial delivery supported), MPX-002 (dependency-reverse decommission), MPX-006 (DEGRADED is a valid terminal state when accepted), MPX-008 (compound payload fully assembled by DCM before dispatch). |




### Authority Tier Model Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Authority Tier Registry** | The ordered list of authority tiers that governs approval routing across all DCM pipelines. Stored as a versioned registry entry. Changes require impact detection before activation.  |
| **Tier Impact Diff** | Computed before any tier registry change activates. Compares proposed ordered list to current list; classifies each changed tier as SECURITY_DEGRADATION, BROKEN_REFERENCE, PROFILE_GAP, SECURITY_UPGRADE, or NEW. |
| **SECURITY_DEGRADATION** | Impact classification for a tier whose gravity or position decreased after a registry change. Blocks registry activation until explicitly accepted by a verified-tier or above reviewer (ATM-009). |
| **BROKEN_REFERENCE** | Impact classification when a tier name referenced in active configuration no longer exists in the registry. Blocks activation until resolved (ATM-010). |
| **PROFILE_GAP** | Impact classification when a profile's threshold list is incomplete after new tier insertion. Warning only — does not block activation (ATM-012). | Stored as a versioned registry entry. Custom tiers are inserted into the list by position; existing tier names remain stable. |
| **decision_gravity** | Stable, position-independent severity classification on each tier: `none` (auto), `routine` (reviewed), `elevated` (verified), `critical` (authorized). Used by the scoring model and profile system to reason about tier severity independently of tier names. |
| **Tier Weight** | Numeric value derived from a tier's position in the ordered list. Never hardcoded — resolved at evaluation time. Stored in approval records for point-in-time audit (ATM-008). |
| **Custom Tier** | An organization-defined tier inserted between existing tiers. Must declare `decision_gravity` consistent with position. Requires `verified` tier approval to contribute (ATM-004). |
| **ATM-001–ATM-008** | Authority Tier Model system policies. Key: ATM-001 (tiers identified by name; weight derived from position), ATM-002 (auto tier max_score ≤ 50), ATM-003 (custom tier gravity must be consistent with position), ATM-008 (approval records store weight at creation for point-in-time audit). |


### Authority Tier Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Authority Tier** | The required organizational authority level for a decision, expressed as a named position in an ordered list. DCM defines four tiers; organizations define what constitutes sufficient authority at each level. |
| **`auto`** | No human judgment required. System confidence (scoring, validation) is sufficient to proceed. |
| **`reviewed`** | Standard authority required. One qualified reviewer in the relevant domain must record a decision via the DCM Admin API. Who constitutes a qualified reviewer is the organization's definition. |
| **`verified`** | Elevated authority required. Two independent, distinct reviewers must each record a decision. The same actor cannot satisfy both. Enforces separation of duties. |
| **`authorized`** | Highest authority level required. Most consequential decisions — policy governance changes, regulated actions, high-risk provider registrations. N members of a declared DCMGroup must record decisions via the Admin API. The authority group composition (CTO, CISO, security board, one person with delegated authority) is entirely the organization's definition. |
| **DCMGroup (authority context)** | A declared set of actors who constitute the required authority for `authorized` tier decisions. Platform admin declares membership; quorum threshold (N of M) is profile-governed. |
| **`recorded_via`** | Audit field on approval decisions capturing which system submitted the decision (dcm_admin_ui, servicenow, jira, slack_bot, api_direct). Informational for audit; not enforced. |


### Design Priority Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Design Priority Order** | The four-priority hierarchy governing all DCM design decisions: (1) Security — industry best practices are the baseline; (2) Ease of use — secure path must be easy path; (3) Extensibility — adaptable through configuration not code; (4) Fit for purpose — always required. |
| **DPO-001–006** | Design Priority system policies. Key: DPO-001 (security properties present in all profiles), DPO-002 (every security requirement needs ease-of-use mechanism), DPO-005 (`minimal` profile = minimal overhead not minimal security), DPO-006 (when security and ease conflict, redesign ease-of-use not security). |
| **Priority 1 (Security)** | Security properties are architecturally present in ALL profiles. Profiles control enforcement strictness and automation level — never whether the property exists. Non-negotiable across all profiles: CPX-001, SMX-004, SMX-008, CPX-003, CPX-005 first retrieval audit, forbidden algorithm baseline. |
| **Priority 2 (Ease of use)** | The secure path must also be the easy path. Every security requirement must be accompanied by an ease-of-use mechanism. The scoring model auto-approval threshold, profile defaults, and Flow GUI visual condition builder are all Priority 2 implementations. |

### Scoring Model Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **enforcement_class** | Required property of GateKeeper policies. `compliance`: boolean deny gate — always halts on fire. `operational`: contributes `risk_score_contribution` to the request risk score. |
| **output_class** | Required property of Validation policies. `structural`: boolean pass/fail. `advisory`: contributes completeness score and warnings without blocking. |
| **request_risk_score** | Aggregate score (0–100) assembled from five weighted signals: operational GateKeeper contributions, completeness, actor risk history, quota pressure, provider accreditation richness. Drives approval routing. |
| **risk_score_contribution** | The weighted score a fired operational-class GateKeeper contributes to the request risk score. Declared as `scoring_weight` (1–100) in the policy. |
| **completeness_score** | Aggregate of advisory Validation contributions. Represents how incomplete or unusual the request is — higher = more warnings. Does not block requests. |
| **actor_risk_history_score** | Decay-weighted (λ=0.1, half-life ≈7 days) history of an actor's previous request outcomes. Contributes to request risk score. Not exposed to other consumers. |
| **quota_pressure_score** | Continuous score representing how close a Tenant is to quota limits for the requested resource type. Zero below 75% utilization; 100 at full quota. |
| **accreditation_richness_score** | Weighted sum of a provider's accreditation portfolio normalized to 0–100. Influences placement preference and inversely contributes to provider risk signal. |
| **scoring_threshold** | Profile-governed boundary on the request risk score that maps to an approval routing tier. Four tiers: auto_approve, reviewed, verified, authorized. `auto_approve_below` may not exceed 50 (SMX-008). |
| **Risk Score Aggregator** | Sub-function of the Policy Engine. Assembles five scoring signals into the request risk score after all compliance-class and Governance Matrix evaluations complete. |
| **regulatory_mandate** | Policy metadata flag. When `true`, the policy's `enforcement_class: compliance` cannot be demoted to operational by any profile (SMX-003). Set by platform admins, audited. |
| **score_drivers** | Human-readable list of the top contributing factors to a request risk score. Exposed to consumers (top 3 only). Full breakdown in Score Record for platform admins. |
| **Score Record** | Immutable audit artifact recording the full signal breakdown, weights, routing decision, and threshold applied for a scored request evaluation. Written to Audit Store for every scored request. |


### Federation Topology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Peer DCM** | A federated DCM instance. Treated as a typed Provider. Trust postures: verified (manually approved), vouched (Hub-introduced), provisional (crypto-verified only). |
| **Hub DCM** | A DCM instance that coordinates Regional DCMs in hub-spoke topology. Policy distribution source. Cannot force-activate policies on Regional DCMs. |
| **Regional DCM** | A DCM instance in a specific sovereignty region, managed by a Hub DCM. |
| **Federation Tunnel** | Mutually authenticated, encrypted, scoped channel between DCM instances. Establishes secure transport — not implicit trust. |
| **Federated Contribution** | A Peer DCM contributing registry entries, policy templates, or service layers to a receiving DCM, scoped by the peer's federation trust posture. |

## Part 2 — Anti-Vocabulary

Terms to avoid because they introduce ambiguity. Use the precise alternatives instead.

| Avoid | Because | Use Instead |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Widget** | Vague — what thing, exactly? | Name the specific resource type (VirtualMachine, IPAddress, VLAN, etc.) |
| **Realize** (standalone) | Ambiguous — "realize" can mean understand, achieve, or provision | **Provision** a VM, **fulfill** a request, **execute** a process. "Realized State" is accepted vocabulary. |
| **Data Center** (as architectural term) | A building — not architecturally meaningful | **Region** (large geographically distinct area) or **Zone** / **Availability Zone** (isolated group within a Region) |
| **Orchestrator** (as a standalone component) | Suggests a single sequencer; DCM orchestration is policy-driven, not procedural | **Request Orchestrator** (the event bus) + **Orchestration Flow Policy** (named workflow) + **Policy Engine** (evaluator) |
| **Tangible / Intangible** | Nothing in DCM architecture is intangible — these words add no precision | Describe what the thing actually is |
| **Workflow** (without qualification) | Ambiguous between Level 1 (named Orchestration Flow Policy) and general process | **Named Workflow** (Orchestration Flow Policy with `ordered: true`) or **dynamic policy** (conditional policy) |
