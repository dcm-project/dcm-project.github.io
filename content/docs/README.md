# DCM Documentation

Data Center Management (DCM) is an open-source governing framework for enterprise on-premises and sovereign cloud infrastructure. It provides a hyperscaler-like cloud experience on infrastructure that organizations own and control.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/dcm-project

---

## Architecture in One Sentence

DCM is built on three foundational abstractions — **Data**, **Provider**, and **Policy** — connected by a policy-driven event loop. Every concept maps to one of these three. See [00-foundations.md](data-model/00-foundations.md).

## Core Principles

1. **Declarative** — data describes desired state, not procedures
2. **API-First** — every capability available via standard API
3. **Policy-Governed** — all business logic through the Policy Engine, never hard-coded
4. **Idempotent** — applying the same data multiple times produces the same result
5. **Immutable if Versioned** — published versions never change; changes produce new versions
6. **Provider-Agnostic** — DCM defines contracts, not implementations
7. **GitOps-Native** — intent and policy artifacts are Git-native
8. **Federated by Default** — all authorized actor types contribute within permitted scope
9. **Easy to use · Easy to implement · Easy to extend**

## Capabilities Matrix

[DCM-Capabilities-Matrix.md](DCM-Capabilities-Matrix.md) — 126 capabilities across 20 domains including: Identity and Access, Service Catalog, Request Lifecycle, Provider Contract, Resource Lifecycle, Drift Detection, Policy Management, Data Layer, Information Integration, Ingestion, Audit, Observability, Storage, Federation, Platform Governance, Accreditation, Zero Trust, Governance Matrix, Drift Reconciliation, Federated Contribution, and Scoring Model (enforcement_class / approval routing thresholds).

**Minimum viable end-to-end set:** 21 capabilities (IAM-001 → AUD-001 critical path).
