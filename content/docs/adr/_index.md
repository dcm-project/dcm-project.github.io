Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant architectural choices made during DCM development, including context, considered alternatives, and rationale.

## Why ADRs?

- **Transparency** — Document the reasoning behind technical decisions
- **Onboarding** — Help new contributors understand the architecture
- **History** — Track how and why the system evolved over time

## Contributing

To propose a new ADR, follow the [ADR template](https://github.com/dcm-project/dcm-project.github.io/blob/main/content/docs/adr/adr-template.md) and submit a pull request for review.
