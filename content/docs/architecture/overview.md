## What is DCM?

DCM (Data Center Management) is an open-source **governing framework** for
enterprise on-premises and sovereign cloud infrastructure. It provides a
hyperscaler-like cloud experience — the operational model and self-service
capabilities of a public cloud provider — on infrastructure that organizations
own and control.

DCM is **not a provisioning tool**. It is the management plane that sits above
provisioning tools, governing what gets requested, approved, built, owned, and
decommissioned. Provisioning tools (Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes operators)
become Service Providers that DCM orchestrates.

**Mission:** Seamlessly manage the complete lifecycle of all data center
infrastructure by providing a policy-governed, data-driven, and unified platform
to enable and ensure sovereignty.

## The Problem DCM Solves

Enterprise organizations managing private cloud infrastructure face consistent
challenges that public cloud providers have already solved — and that DCM brings
to on-premises:

| Challenge | DCM Response |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fragmented operations** — disparate tools, no unified control | Single control plane — one API, one data model, one policy engine |
| **No source of truth** — multiple CMDBs diverge | Four-state model provides authoritative record of intent, request, realized, and discovered state |
| **High time-to-market** — a VM may require dozens of teams | Self-service catalog with policy-governed automation |
| **Drift and state discrepancy** — no reconciliation between intended and actual | Continuous drift detection comparing realized vs discovered state |
| **Sovereignty requirements** — data residency, compliance, audit evidence | Policy Engine with sovereignty enforcement, complete provenance chain |

---

## Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Declarative** | Data describes what should exist, not how to achieve it |
| **API-First** | Every capability is available via a standard API |
| **Policy-Governed** | All business logic flows through the Policy Engine — not hard-coded |
| **Idempotent** | Applying the same data multiple times always produces the same result |
| **Immutable if Versioned** | Published versions never change — changes produce new versions |
| **Provider-Agnostic** | DCM defines contracts, not implementations |
| **GitOps-Native** | Intent and Requested state are Git-native — branched, reviewed, versioned |
| **Kubernetes Superset** | DCM extends Kubernetes upward — operators become DCM Service Providers |

---

## Architecture Overview

DCM consists of four major architectural layers:

## The Four States

Every resource in DCM exists across four independently maintained state records:

| State | Question | Store |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Intent** | What did the consumer ask for? | GitOps — immutable, branched, PR reviewed |
| **Requested** | What was approved and dispatched? | GitOps — assembled, policy-processed, full provenance |
| **Realized** | What did the provider actually build? | Event Stream — append-only, entity-keyed |
| **Discovered** | What actually exists right now? | Event Stream — ground truth for drift detection |

The **entity UUID** is the universal linking key — assigned at Intent State creation, it links the entity across all four states and all stores throughout its entire lifecycle.

---

## The Data Model

The DCM Data Model is the foundational layer that governs how all data is
represented, versioned, assembled, and governed. Key concepts:

**Data Layers** assemble a complete request payload from composable, versioned
units of configuration. 36 layer definitions can govern 40,000 VMs without
duplication. Layers are organized by Domain (system, platform, tenant, service,
provider), identified by a human-readable Handle, and ordered by a hierarchical
Priority Schema for deterministic conflict resolution.

**Resource Types** are portable, vendor-neutral definitions of resource classes.
They live in the DCM Resource Type Registry alongside Information Types
(Business.*, Identity.*, Compliance.*) — same registry, different category prefix.

**Entity Relationships** use a universal bidirectional model for all connections
between entities — whether VM-to-Storage, Application-to-WebServer, or
Resource-to-BusinessUnit. One model, all relationships.

**Field Override Control** uses a graduated three-level model: no declaration
(allow by default), simple `override: immutable`, or a full actor-permission
matrix. The Policy Engine is the sole authority for setting override control.

**Artifact Metadata** is universal — every layer, policy, resource type, catalog
item, and provider registration carries a standard metadata block with creator,
owner, modification history, and contact information.

---

## Provider Model

DCM defines **contracts**, not implementations. Four provider types:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Service Provider** | Realizes resources — KubeVirt, VMware, Ansible, Terraform |
| **Information Provider** | Serves authoritative external data DCM references but does not own |
| **Meta Provider** | Composes multiple providers into higher-order services |
| **Storage Provider** | Persists DCM state — GitOps stores, event streams, audit store |

All providers follow the same registration, health check, trust, and contract model.

---

## Policy Engine

The Policy Engine is the single authoritative logic gate for all business rules.
Three policy types in execution order:

1. **Transformation** — enriches and modifies the payload; may set field constraints
2. **Validation** — checks payload against rules; pass/fail, no modification
3. **GateKeeper** — highest authority; can override any field; enforces sovereignty

Policies follow a three-tier hierarchy: Global → Tenant → User. A Global policy
cannot be overridden by Tenant or User policies. The Policy Engine uses OPA/Rego
for policy implementation.

Policies support five statuses: **developing** (dev mode only), **proposed**
(shadow execution — output captured but not applied, for validation),
**active**, **deprecated**, and **retired**.

## Kubernetes as a Superset

DCM is designed as a **superset of Kubernetes** — extending Kubernetes' declarative
model upward to the management plane:

| Kubernetes | DCM |
|-----------|-----|
| Single cluster | Multi-cluster, multi-infrastructure |
| Namespace isolation | First-class Tenant ownership model |
| RBAC + admission webhooks | Policy Engine with field-level override control |
| No cost attribution | Full lifecycle cost analysis |
| No cross-cluster management | Unified management plane |

Kubernetes operators become DCM Service Providers through the
[DCM Operator Interface Specification](specifications/operator-interface-spec/).
The [DCM Operator SDK](specifications/operator-sdk-api/) enables Level 1 conformance
in one day.

## Digital Sovereignty

DCM addresses four sovereignty dimensions:

| Dimension | DCM Enabler |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data and Content Sovereignty** | Data Model, Policy Engine, Validated Providers |
| **Operational Sovereignty** | Policy Engine — Sovereign Execution Posture |
| **Security and Compliance** | Audit, GRC, complete provenance chain |
| **Mobility and Placement** | Policy Engine placement constraints, provider portability |

**Sovereign Execution Posture** — the target end state where all operations are
governed, auditable, and compliant with sovereignty requirements. This is the
north star concept of DCM.

---

## Request Lifecycle

A complete request lifecycle from consumer intent to realized resource:

```
Consumer submits request
  │
  ▼  [Git branch created — CI pipeline fires]
Intent State captured (immutable consumer declaration)
  │  CI: policy pre-validation, cost estimate, sovereignty check
  │  Human review via PR (if policy requires)
  ▼  [PR merged — CD pipeline fires]
Request Payload Processor — Nine-Step Assembly
  │
  │  Steps 1-4: Layer assembly
  │    Base → Core → Intermediate → Service → Request Layer
  │
  │  Step 5: Pre-Placement Policies
  │    Transformation → Validation → GateKeeper
  │    Outputs: placement constraints
  │
  │  Step 6: Placement Engine — Placement Loop
  │    For each candidate provider:
  │      Reserve Query (atomic: verify + metadata + hold)
  │      Loop Policy Phase (evaluates reserve query response)
  │        pass → Placement confirmed
  │        reject_candidate → next candidate
  │        gatekeep → request rejected
  │
  │  Step 7: Post-Placement Policies
  │    Transformation → Validation → GateKeeper
  │    Provider-aware enrichment and validation
  │
  ▼
Requested State committed to Git (full provenance chain)
  │  Includes: placement block, hold records, policy gap records
  ▼
Provider dispatch via API Gateway (hold confirmed)
  │  Naturalization: DCM format → provider native format
  │  Provider realizes resource, returns full metadata
  │  Denaturalization: provider native → DCM format
  ▼
Realized State (event stream, provider-confirmed)
  │  enrichment_status updated as metadata arrives
  ▼  [Continuous]
Drift Detection: Discovered State vs Realized State
  │  Unsanctioned changes → Policy Engine response
  │  Drift → REVERT | UPDATE | ALERT | ESCALATE
```
