## 1. Three Health Endpoints

DCM exposes three distinct health endpoints, following Kubernetes conventions:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Failure action | Authentication |
|----------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| `GET /livez` | Is DCM alive? | Kubernetes restarts the pod | None |
| `GET /readyz` | Is DCM ready to serve traffic? | Kubernetes removes from load balancer | None |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/health` | Detailed component status | Informational — no automatic action | Admin auth required |

Liveness and readiness are unauthenticated because they must work before authentication infrastructure is operational (e.g. during startup).

---

## 2. Liveness — `/livez`

Liveness answers: **is this DCM process alive?**

A liveness failure means the process is deadlocked, in an unrecoverable state, or otherwise unable to continue. Kubernetes responds by restarting the pod.

```http
GET /livez HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/health+json

{
  "status": "pass"
}
```

**Liveness checks (minimal — fast):**
- Process is responding
- No deadlock detected in core event loop
- Internal CA is reachable (for deployments with component auth)

**Liveness failure response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Content-Type: application/health+json

{
  "status": "fail",
  "failure_reason": "event_loop_deadlock | internal_ca_unreachable | oom_imminent"
}
```

**Liveness SLA:** Must respond within PT5S. No external calls. No database reads.

---

## 3. Readiness — `/readyz`

Readiness answers: **is this DCM instance ready to serve requests?**

A readiness failure removes the instance from the load balancer rotation without restarting it. This handles startup, migration, and graceful drain scenarios.

```http
GET /readyz HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/health+json

{
  "status": "pass",
  "checks": {
    "session_store": "pass",
    "audit_store": "pass",
    "policy_engine": "pass",
    "message_bus": "pass",
    "auth_provider": "pass"
  }
}
```

**Readiness checks:**
- Session Store: can write and read a test record
- Audit Store: reachable and writable
- Policy Engine: responding to internal health ping
- Message Bus: connected and subscribed
- Auth Provider: at least one Auth Provider is responding
- Schema version: database schema matches running code version

**Readiness failure** (any check fails):
```http
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Content-Type: application/health+json

{
  "status": "fail",
  "checks": {
    "session_store": "pass",
    "audit_store": "fail",
    "policy_engine": "pass",
    "message_bus": "pass",
    "auth_provider": "pass"
  },
  "failing_checks": ["audit_store"]
}
```

**Readiness SLA:** Must respond within PT10S. Performs lightweight connectivity checks — no heavy queries.

### 3.1 Startup vs Operational Readiness

During startup, DCM goes through a startup sequence before becoming ready:

```
Process starts
  │
  ▼ /livez → pass (process alive)
  │   /readyz → fail (not ready yet)
  │
  ▼ Internal CA connects → component certs verified
  ▼ Session Store connected → revocation registry loaded
  ▼ Audit Store connected → schema version validated
  ▼ Policy Engine ready → policies loaded and shadow mode initialized
  ▼ Auth Providers connected → at least one responding
  ▼ Message Bus connected → subscriptions established
  │
  ▼ /readyz → pass (ready to serve traffic)
```

`startupProbe` in Kubernetes uses `/readyz` with a longer `failureThreshold` to allow startup time before the liveness probe takes over.

---

## 4. Detailed Health — `/api/v1/admin/health`

The detailed health endpoint provides per-component status for operational monitoring. Requires admin authentication.

```http
GET /api/v1/admin/health HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/health+json

### 4.1 Status Semantics

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pass` | Component fully operational |
| `warn` | Operational but degraded (high latency, reduced capacity, elevated error rate) |
| `fail` | Component not operational; DCM degraded |

The top-level `status` is the worst status across all components:
- Any `fail` → top-level `fail`
- Any `warn`, no `fail` → top-level `warn`
- All `pass` → top-level `pass`

## 5. Kubernetes Manifest

```yaml
# Standard Kubernetes probe configuration for DCM
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /livez
    port: 8443
    scheme: HTTPS
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 3
  timeoutSeconds: 5

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /readyz
    port: 8443
    scheme: HTTPS
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 5
  failureThreshold: 6
  timeoutSeconds: 10

startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /readyz
    port: 8443
    scheme: HTTPS
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 30    # allow up to 300s for startup
  timeoutSeconds: 10
```

## 6. Prometheus Metrics

DCM exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics alongside health endpoints:

```
GET /metrics      # Prometheus scrape endpoint (unauthenticated in cluster; 
                  # configurable for external exposure)
```

Key metric families:

```
# Request pipeline
dcm_requests_total{status, resource_type, profile}
dcm_request_duration_seconds{quantile, resource_type}
dcm_requests_pending_dependency_total
dcm_requests_scheduled_total

# Policy engine
dcm_policy_evaluations_total{outcome, enforcement_class}
dcm_policy_shadow_divergences_total

# Sessions
dcm_sessions_active_total
dcm_session_revocations_total{trigger}

# Drift
dcm_drift_open_records_total{severity}
dcm_drift_detected_total

# Providers
dcm_providers_registered_total
dcm_providers_healthy_total
dcm_provider_dispatch_duration_seconds{provider_type, quantile}

# Internal
dcm_internal_ca_certificates_active
dcm_internal_ca_days_until_next_expiry
```

## 8. Profile-Governed Health Exposure

| Profile | /livez | /readyz | /api/v1/admin/health | /metrics scraping |
|---------|--------|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `minimal` | Unauthenticated | Unauthenticated | Admin auth | Internal network only |
| `dev` | Unauthenticated | Unauthenticated | Admin auth | Internal network only |
| `standard` | Unauthenticated | Unauthenticated | Admin auth | mTLS client cert or auth token |
| `prod` | Unauthenticated | Unauthenticated | Admin auth | mTLS client cert or auth token |
| `fsi` | Unauthenticated | Unauthenticated | Admin auth (MFA required) | mTLS + authorized scraper registration |
| `sovereign` | Unauthenticated within cluster | Unauthenticated within cluster | Admin auth (MFA + step-up) | Disabled externally; internal only |

**Notes:**
- `/livez` and `/readyz` are always unauthenticated *within the cluster* — Kubernetes probes cannot present auth credentials. However, at the ingress boundary (external load balancer), these paths may be network-restricted.
- For `fsi` and `sovereign` profiles, `/api/v1/admin/health` requires MFA-verified sessions (mfa_verified: true). Step-up MFA is required for sovereign.
- The `sovereign` profile does not expose `/metrics` externally. Prometheus must scrape from within the cluster network only.
- Component-level detail in `/api/v1/admin/health` may be redacted in fsi/sovereign profiles based on the requesting actor's role — SRE sees full detail; read-only admin sees summary only.

## 7. System Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `HLT-001` | DCM must expose `/livez` and `/readyz` endpoints on the same port as the API, unauthenticated, following RFC 8615 / IANA health+json format. |
| `HLT-002` | `/livez` must respond within PT5S with no external calls or database reads. A non-response within PT5S is treated as liveness failure. |
| `HLT-003` | `/readyz` returns `fail` if the Session Store, Audit Store, Policy Engine, Message Bus, or any Auth Provider is unreachable. It returns `warn` if any optional component is degraded. |
| `HLT-004` | `GET /api/v1/admin/health` requires admin authentication and provides per-component status. It must include the DCM version, instance UUID, and deployment profile. |
| `HLT-005` | DCM must expose Prometheus-compatible metrics at `GET /metrics`. Metrics must include request pipeline, policy engine, session, drift, and provider metrics at minimum. |
| `HLT-006` | The startup sequence must be observable via `/readyz`. DCM must not report `pass` on `/readyz` until the Session Store, Audit Store, Policy Engine, Auth Provider, and Message Bus are all reachable. |
