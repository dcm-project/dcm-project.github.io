> **Universal Group Model:** Policy Groups (`group_class: policy_collection`) and Policy Profiles (`group_class: policy_profile`) are expressions of the [Universal Group Model](15-universal-groups.md). The structures defined in this document remain authoritative for policy-specific behavior; the universal model adds composability, cross-type membership, and the ability to include policy groups within composite groups.

## 1. Purpose

DCM's Policy Engine is powerful — but power without usability is a barrier to adoption. This document defines the **policy organization model**: the structures that make DCM easy to configure correctly for any use case, from a home lab evaluation to a sovereign financial services deployment.

Three concepts work together:

- **Policy Groups** — cohesive collections of policies addressing a single identifiable concern (a technology, a compliance standard, a sovereignty requirement, a business process)
- **Policy Profiles** — complete DCM configurations for a specific use case, composed of Policy Groups
- **Policy Providers** — external authoritative sources that supply policies directly into DCM, extending the provider model to its fifth type

The relationship is compositional:

```
Policy Profile     — complete use-case configuration
  │  composed of
  ▼
Policy Groups      — single-concern policy collections
  │  composed of
  ▼
Policies           — individual Transformation / Validation / GateKeeper rules
  │  optionally sourced from
  ▼
Policy Providers   — external authoritative policy sources
```

## 2. Policy Groups
## 1a. Two-Dimensional Profile Model

### 1a.1 The Gap in the Original Model

The original six profiles (minimal → sovereign) are organized around **deployment posture** — how strict, how redundant, how governed. But organizations need compliance governance that is orthogonal to posture. A healthcare organization needs HIPAA controls regardless of whether they deploy at `standard` or `sovereign` posture. A payment processor needs PCI-DSS regardless of their redundancy profile.

The new model makes compliance a first-class dimension that composes with posture:

```
Complete Profile = Deployment Posture Group + Compliance Domain Group(s)
```

### 1a.2 Dimension 1 — Deployment Posture Groups

Posture groups govern how the DCM infrastructure itself behaves — redundancy, enforcement strictness, audit retention, tenancy model, cross-tenant defaults. These are the vertical axis from least to most governed.

| Group Handle | Posture | Key Behaviors |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| `system/group/posture-minimal` | Minimal | Advisory only; single instance; no redundancy |
| `system/group/posture-dev` | Development | Warn-not-block; basic logging; ephemeral defaults |
| `system/group/posture-standard` | Standard | Full enforcement; 3-replica; explicit cross-tenant |
| `system/group/posture-prod` | Production | Full enforcement + SLA; geo-replicated; cost governance |
| `system/group/posture-hardened` | Enterprise Hardened | 5-replica; 7-year audit; hard tenancy; dual approval |
| `system/group/posture-sovereign` | Sovereign | Air-gap; deny_all cross-tenant; 10-year audit; signed bundles |

### 1a.3 Dimension 2 — Compliance Domain Groups

Compliance domain groups govern what data handling, audit, and control requirements apply to resources managed by DCM. Multiple compliance domains can apply simultaneously.

| Group Handle | Domain | Key Controls |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `system/group/compliance-fsi` | Financial Services | Basel III, SOX, Dodd-Frank financial controls |
| `system/group/compliance-pci-dss` | Payment Card | PCI-DSS v4 — payment card industry |
| `system/group/compliance-hipaa` | Healthcare | HIPAA/HITECH PHI handling and audit |
| `system/group/compliance-fedramp-moderate` | US Federal Moderate | FedRAMP Moderate — NIST 800-53 Moderate baseline |
| `system/group/compliance-fedramp-high` | US Federal High | FedRAMP High — NIST 800-53 High baseline |
| `system/group/compliance-dod-il2` | DoD IL2 | Public/unclassified defense data |
| `system/group/compliance-dod-il4` | DoD IL4 | Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) |
| `system/group/compliance-dod-il5` | DoD IL5 | National Security Systems non-classified |
| `system/group/compliance-dod-il6` | DoD IL6 | Classified — maximum sovereign posture |
| `system/group/compliance-government` | Government General | General government/public sector controls |
| `system/group/compliance-gdpr` | EU Data Protection | GDPR data residency and rights |
| `system/group/compliance-iso27001` | ISO 27001 | Information security management |
| `system/group/compliance-nist-800-53` | NIST 800-53 | NIST security control framework |
| `system/group/compliance-soc2` | SOC 2 | Service organization controls |
| `system/group/compliance-nerc-cip` | Critical Infrastructure | Energy/utilities NERC CIP |
| `system/group/compliance-sovereign` | Sovereign/Classified | Sovereign deployment, air-gap, classified |

### 1a.4 Compliance Domain Group Contents

#### `system/group/compliance-hipaa`

HIPAA/HITECH controls for Protected Health Information (PHI):
- PHI field classification enforcement (fields containing PHI must be tagged `phi: true`)
- PHI access control (only roles with `phi_authorized: true` may access PHI-tagged fields)
- Audit retention: P6Y minimum (HIPAA requires 6 years from creation or last use)
- Encryption at rest: AES-256 required for all PHI storage
- Transmission security: TLS 1.3 minimum for PHI in transit
- Breach notification workflow: sovereignty_violation_record triggers HIPAA breach assessment
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) tracking: providers handling PHI must declare `baa_in_place: true` in sovereignty_declaration
- Right to Access: consumer data export capability required for PHI entities
- Minimum Necessary standard: data_request_spec on Mode 4 providers limited to minimum PHI fields

#### `system/group/compliance-government`

General government and public sector controls:
- Data classification mandatory on all resources (classification_level field required)
- Cross-boundary controls: data cannot cross classification levels without explicit policy
- Audit retention: P10Y minimum
- Air-gap capability required for Sensitive compartments
- Actor authentication must declare clearance level in external_identity claims
- All provider sovereignty_declarations must declare government_access_risk

#### `system/group/compliance-fedramp-moderate`

FedRAMP Moderate authorization controls:
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Moderate baseline implemented as policy group
- FedRAMP-authorized provider preference injected as placement constraint
- Continuous monitoring: drift detection mandatory; P24H maximum drift resolution window
- Incident response: webhook required for security events (audit.chain_break, drift.escalated)
- POA&M tracking: `poam_status` field in status_metadata on all policy artifacts
- Boundary protection: explicit ingress/egress control documentation

#### `system/group/compliance-dod-il4`

DoD Impact Level 4 — Controlled Unclassified Information:
- Inherits compliance-fedramp-moderate
- CUI handling markers on all data fields containing controlled information
- Sovereign posture within US jurisdiction boundary
- Provider sovereignty_declaration must exclude foreign sub-processors
- CMMC Level 2 cyber hygiene controls

#### `system/group/compliance-sovereign`

Sovereign and classified deployment controls:
- All data must remain within declared sovereignty boundary
- Air-gap capability: provider air_gap_capable: true required
- Signed bundle import only — no live registry connectivity
- deny_all cross-tenant cross-boundary data flows
- Hardware security module (HSM) required for key management
- Audit records: 10-year retention; cryptographic signing required

### 1a.5 Profile Composition Model

The six built-in profiles become explicit posture+compliance compositions:

```yaml
system/profile/minimal:
  policy_groups: [system/group/posture-minimal]

system/profile/dev:
  extends: system/profile/minimal
  policy_groups: [system/group/posture-dev]

system/profile/standard:
  extends: system/profile/dev
  policy_groups: [system/group/posture-standard]

system/profile/prod:
  extends: system/profile/standard
  policy_groups: [system/group/posture-prod]

system/profile/fsi:
  extends: system/profile/prod
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/posture-hardened
    - system/group/compliance-fsi
    - system/group/compliance-pci-dss
    - system/group/compliance-iso27001

system/profile/sovereign:
  extends: system/profile/fsi
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/posture-sovereign
    - system/group/compliance-sovereign
```

### 1a.6 DCM Built-In Extended Profiles

In addition to the six core profiles, DCM ships extended profiles for common compliance domains:

```yaml
system/profile/hipaa-prod:
  extends: system/profile/prod
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-hipaa
    - system/group/compliance-iso27001
  description: "Production infrastructure with HIPAA/HITECH compliance"

system/profile/hipaa-sovereign:
  extends: system/profile/sovereign
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-hipaa
  description: "Sovereign deployment with HIPAA/HITECH compliance — highest healthcare posture"

system/profile/fedramp-moderate:
  extends: system/profile/prod
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-fedramp-moderate
    - system/group/compliance-nist-800-53
  description: "FedRAMP Moderate authorized deployment"

system/profile/fedramp-high:
  extends: system/profile/sovereign
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-fedramp-high
    - system/group/compliance-nist-800-53
  description: "FedRAMP High authorized deployment"

system/profile/government:
  extends: system/profile/prod
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-government
    - system/group/compliance-nist-800-53
  description: "General government and public sector deployment"

system/profile/dod-il4:
  extends: system/profile/sovereign
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-dod-il4
    - system/group/compliance-fedramp-high
    - system/group/compliance-nist-800-53
  description: "DoD Impact Level 4 — Controlled Unclassified Information"

system/profile/dod-il5:
  extends: system/profile/dod-il4
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-dod-il5
  description: "DoD Impact Level 5 — National Security Systems non-classified"

system/profile/dod-il6:
  extends: system/profile/dod-il5
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-dod-il6
    - system/group/compliance-sovereign
  description: "DoD Impact Level 6 — Classified"
```

### 1a.7 Organization Custom Profiles — Composition Examples

```yaml
# Healthcare with federal cloud authorization
org/profile/hipaa-fedramp:
  extends: system/profile/fedramp-moderate
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-hipaa
  description: "Healthcare workloads on FedRAMP Moderate platform"

# Multi-compliance financial + healthcare
org/profile/fsi-hipaa:
  extends: system/profile/fsi
  policy_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-hipaa
  description: "FSI-grade deployment for organizations managing both financial and health data"

# Tenant-level compliance override — platform is standard; this Tenant is PCI-scoped
# (declared in tenant_config — not profile)
tenant_compliance_overlay:
  active_profile: system/profile/standard    # platform posture
  compliance_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-pci-dss        # this Tenant handles payment cards
    - system/group/compliance-hipaa          # this Tenant also handles PHI
  # Other Tenants on same platform have standard posture, no compliance overlay
```

### 1a.8 Compliance at Tenant Level

Compliance domain groups may apply at Tenant level — different Tenants on the same DCM deployment can have different compliance domains:

```yaml
tenant_config:
  active_profile: system/profile/prod        # posture from platform
  compliance_groups:
    - system/group/compliance-hipaa          # this Tenant handles PHI
    - system/group/compliance-pci-dss        # this Tenant processes payments
```

This is the critical capability: **one DCM deployment, multiple compliance postures per Tenant**. A hospital system can run a single DCM with: clinical Tenants (HIPAA), billing Tenants (HIPAA + PCI-DSS), and administrative Tenants (standard) — all on the same platform profile.

### 1a.9 System Policies — Profile Composition

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `PROF-001` | Profiles compose a Deployment Posture Group with zero or more Compliance Domain Groups. Posture groups govern DCM infrastructure behavior. Compliance domain groups govern data handling, audit, and control requirements. |
| `PROF-002` | Compliance Domain Groups may be applied at platform level (all Tenants) or Tenant level (specific Tenants). Tenant-level compliance groups are additive — they do not replace platform-level groups. |
| `PROF-003` | DCM ships built-in Compliance Domain Groups for: FSI, PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP Moderate, FedRAMP High, DoD IL2-IL6, Government, GDPR, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, SOC2, NERC-CIP, and Sovereign/Classified. Organizations extend these groups or compose them into custom profiles. |
| `PROF-004` | The `implementation_posture` concern_type Policy Groups (provenance model, auth simplicity, deployment complexity) are independent of compliance domain — organizations select their implementation posture separately from their compliance requirements. |

### 2.1 Definition

A **Policy Group** is a versioned, cohesive collection of policies that together address a **single identifiable concern**. The group is the unit of reuse — activate a group to enable a concern, not individual policies.

```yaml
policy_group:
  artifact_metadata:
    uuid: <uuid>
    handle: "system/group/pci-dss"
    version: "1.2.0"
    status: active
    owned_by:
      display_name: "DCM Project Team"
      notification_endpoint: <endpoint>

  name: "PCI-DSS v4"
  description: >
    Policy group implementing PCI-DSS v4 controls relevant to
    DCM-managed infrastructure. Enforces encryption standards,
    network segmentation, access control, and audit requirements
    for resources in PCI scope.

  concern_type: compliance
  concern_tags: [pci-dss, financial, encryption, network-segmentation]
  extends: null   # or another group handle — inherits all parent policies

  # Source — locally authored or from a Policy Provider
  source:
    type: <local | policy_provider>
    provider_uuid: <uuid — if policy_provider>
    provider_group_reference: <provider's identifier for this group>
    on_provider_update: <proposed | active>
    # proposed: provider updates require local review before activation
    # active:   provider updates activate immediately (trusted providers only)

  # Constituent policies
  policies:
    - policy_uuid: <uuid>
      handle: "system/gatekeeper/pci-encryption-aes256"
      description: "Enforce AES-256 on all PCI-scoped storage"
      placement_phase: pre
    - policy_uuid: <uuid>
      handle: "system/validation/pci-network-segmentation"
      description: "Validate network segment isolation for PCI resources"
      placement_phase: pre
    - policy_uuid: <uuid>
      handle: "system/transformation/pci-classification-inject"
      description: "Auto-inject PCI classification on scoped resources"
      placement_phase: pre
    - policy_uuid: <uuid>
      handle: "system/gatekeeper/pci-audit-retention"
      description: "Enforce 10-year audit retention for PCI evidence"
      placement_phase: pre

  # Activation scope — surgical application within a profile
  activation_scope:
    resource_types: []          # empty = all resource types
    tenant_tags: [pci-scope]    # only Tenants tagged pci-scope
    regions: []                 # empty = all regions

  # Conflict declarations
  conflicts_with:
    - group_handle: "system/group/dev-defaults"
      reason: "PCI requires blocking enforcement; dev-defaults uses warn-only"
      resolution: this_group_wins
```

### 2.2 Concern Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `technology` | Policies specific to a technology or provider | kubevirt, openstack, kubernetes, vmware |
| `compliance` | Regulatory or standards compliance | pci-dss, iso-27001, nist-800-53, fedramp |
| `sovereignty` | Data residency, jurisdictional, air-gap | gdpr-eu, air-gap, data-residency-uk |
| `business` | Business process, cost, lifecycle governance | cost-governance, ephemeral-resources, chargeback |
| `operational` | Operational posture, defaults, SLAs | dev-defaults, hard-tenancy, sla-enforcement |
| `security` | Security controls and posture | data-classification, zero-trust, encryption-baseline |
| `implementation_posture` | Implementation complexity vs capability trade-offs | provenance-full-inline, provenance-deduplicated, single-instance-deployment, advisory-policies-only |

### 2.3 Group Inheritance

A Policy Group may extend another group — inheriting all its policies and overriding or adding to them:

```yaml
policy_group:
  handle: "org/group/pci-dss-extended"
  extends: "system/group/pci-dss"
  # Inherits all system/group/pci-dss policies
  # Additional policies added below are on top of the parent
  policies:
    - policy_uuid: <uuid>
      handle: "org/gatekeeper/our-pci-additional-control"
```

### 2.4 DCM Built-In Policy Groups

DCM ships the following policy groups as part of its standard distribution:

| Handle | Concern | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `system/group/core-minimal` | operational | Absolute minimum — UUID requirements, basic well-formedness |

| `system/group/provenance-deduplicated` | implementation_posture | Model B — content-addressed deduplication; recommended; 95-99% storage reduction; lossless |
| `system/group/provenance-tiered-archive` | implementation_posture | Model C — hot/warm/cold tiers; balances cost and access speed |
| `system/group/provenance-deduplicated-tiered` | implementation_posture | Model B+C — maximum efficiency for very large-scale deployments |

---

## 3. Policy Profiles

### 3.1 Definition

A **Policy Profile** is a named, versioned, curated composition of Policy Groups that together configure DCM for a specific use case. Activating a profile is the primary configuration mechanism — most deployments should activate a profile and then add organization-specific groups on top rather than configuring policies individually.

```yaml
policy_profile:
  artifact_metadata:
    uuid: <uuid>
    handle: "system/profile/fsi"
    version: "1.0.0"
    status: active
    owned_by:
      display_name: "DCM Project Team"

  name: "FSI Production"
  description: >
    Policy profile for Financial Services production deployments.
    Enforces hard tenancy, regulatory-grade audit retention,
    full sovereignty controls, and explicit cross-tenant authorization.

  target_use_case: fsi_production
  extends: "system/profile/prod"   # inherits all prod groups + overrides

  enforcement_summary:
    tenancy: hard_tenancy_required
    audit_retention_years: 7
    sovereignty: full
    cross_tenant_default: explicit_only
    policy_enforcement: blocking
    immutable_fields: [sovereignty_zone, classification_level, audit_retention]
    policy_version_pinning: permitted_with_elevation

  policy_groups:
    - group_handle: "system/group/fsi-audit"
    - group_handle: "system/group/pci-dss"
    - group_handle: "system/group/gdpr-eu"
    - group_handle: "system/group/hard-tenancy"
    - group_handle: "system/group/explicit-cross-tenant"
    - group_handle: "system/group/encryption-baseline"
```

### 3.2 DCM Built-In Profiles

DCM ships six profiles covering the spectrum from minimal to sovereign:

#### `system/profile/minimal` — Home Lab / Evaluation

```yaml
handle: "system/profile/minimal"
name: "Minimal"
extends: null
description: >
  Minimal configuration for home lab, local testing, and evaluation.
  Most controls advisory only. Single Tenant auto-created on first use.
  No audit requirements. No sovereignty enforcement.

enforcement_summary:
  tenancy: optional
  audit_retention: none
  sovereignty: none
  cross_tenant_default: allow_all
  policy_enforcement: advisory     # policies warn but do not block
  time_constraints: optional

auto_tenant:
  enabled: true
  default_tenant_handle: "default"
  # TEN-001 satisfied silently — no explicit Tenant declaration required

policy_groups:
  - group_handle: "system/group/core-minimal"
```

#### `system/profile/dev` — Development Environments

```yaml
handle: "system/profile/dev"
name: "Development"
extends: "system/profile/minimal"
description: >
  Development environment profile. Tenancy recommended but not blocking.

  audit_retention: basic
  sovereignty: none
  cross_tenant_default: operational_only
  policy_enforcement: warn_only
  default_ttl: P90D              # dev resources default to 90-day TTL

policy_groups:
  - group_handle: "system/group/dev-defaults"
  - group_handle: "system/group/ephemeral-resources"
  - group_handle: "system/group/audit-basic"
```

#### `system/profile/standard` — General Enterprise Production

```yaml
handle: "system/profile/standard"
name: "Standard"
extends: "system/profile/dev"
description: >
  General enterprise production profile. Full policy enforcement.
  Tenancy required. Explicit cross-tenant authorization. Basic
  data classification. Compliance-grade audit.

enforcement_summary:
  tenancy: required
  audit_retention: compliance_grade
  sovereignty: configurable
  cross_tenant_default: explicit_only
  policy_enforcement: blocking

policy_groups:
  - group_handle: "system/group/data-classification"
  - group_handle: "system/group/audit-compliance"
  - group_handle: "system/group/explicit-cross-tenant"
  - group_handle: "system/group/encryption-baseline"
```

#### `system/profile/prod` — Production with SLA Requirements

```yaml
handle: "system/profile/prod"
name: "Production"
extends: "system/profile/standard"
description: >
  Production profile with SLA enforcement, cost governance, and
  full lifecycle constraint enforcement.

enforcement_summary:
  tenancy: required
  audit_retention: compliance_grade
  sovereignty: configurable
  cross_tenant_default: explicit_only
  policy_enforcement: blocking

policy_groups:
  - group_handle: "system/group/cost-governance"
  - group_handle: "system/group/sla-enforcement"
  - group_handle: "system/group/lifecycle-ttl-enforcement"
```

#### `system/profile/fsi` — Financial Services Production

```yaml
handle: "system/profile/fsi"
name: "FSI Production"
extends: "system/profile/prod"
description: >
  Financial services production. Hard tenancy. 7-year audit retention.
  Full sovereignty enforcement. PCI-DSS and GDPR compliance.

enforcement_summary:
  tenancy: hard_tenancy_required
  audit_retention_years: 7
  sovereignty: full
  cross_tenant_default: explicit_only
  policy_enforcement: blocking

policy_groups:
  - group_handle: "system/group/fsi-audit"
  - group_handle: "system/group/pci-dss"
  - group_handle: "system/group/gdpr-eu"
  - group_handle: "system/group/hard-tenancy"
```

#### `system/profile/sovereign` — Air-Gapped / Sovereign Deployments

```yaml
handle: "system/profile/sovereign"
name: "Sovereign"
extends: "system/profile/fsi"
description: >
  Maximum control profile for air-gapped, sovereign, and highest-security
  deployments. Complete tenant isolation. Zero external dependencies.
  Maximum audit and sovereignty enforcement.

enforcement_summary:
  tenancy: hard_tenancy_required
  audit_retention_years: 10
  sovereignty: maximum
  cross_tenant_default: deny_all
  policy_enforcement: blocking
  immutable_ceiling_on_all_sovereignty_fields: true

policy_groups:
  - group_handle: "system/group/air-gap"
  - group_handle: "system/group/zero-trust"
```

### 3.3 Profile Inheritance Chain

```
system/profile/sovereign
  extends: system/profile/fsi
    extends: system/profile/prod
      extends: system/profile/standard
        extends: system/profile/dev
          extends: system/profile/minimal
            extends: null (base)
```

Each level adds groups without replacing parent groups. An organization extending a DCM profile only needs to declare what differs:

```yaml
# Organization custom profile
org/profile/my-prod:
  extends: system/profile/prod
  policy_groups:
    - group_handle: "org/group/our-naming-conventions"
    - group_handle: "org/group/our-cost-centers"
    - group_handle: "system/group/iso-27001"    # add a DCM compliance group
```

### 3.4 Profile Activation

Profiles activate at three levels — more specific takes precedence:

```yaml
# DCM installation default
installation_config:
  default_profile: "system/profile/minimal"

# Platform-level (applies to all Tenants)
platform_config:
  active_profile: "system/profile/prod"
  minimum_tenant_profile: "system/profile/dev"   # Tenants cannot go below this
  maximum_tenant_profile: null                    # null = no ceiling

# Tenant-level override
tenant_config:
  active_profile: "system/profile/fsi"           # must be >= minimum_tenant_profile
```

**A Tenant cannot activate a profile less restrictive than the platform minimum.** A sovereign deployment can set `minimum_tenant_profile: system/profile/sovereign` — no Tenant can drop below that level.

### 3.5 Profile Conflict Resolution

When a profile is activated, DCM runs conflict detection across all constituent group policies — same ingestion conflict detection that layers use. Conflicts must be resolved before a profile is marked `active`.

Conflict resolution order:
1. **Explicit `conflicts_with` declarations** on groups — use declared resolution rule
2. **Priority schema** — higher numeric priority wins
3. **Domain authority** — `system` beats `platform` beats `tenant`
4. **Unresolved** — profile activation fails with detailed conflict report

### 3.6 Profile Shadow Validation

When a profile is in `proposed` status, all its constituent policies run in shadow mode — the same proposed policy shadow execution model. The Validation Dashboard shows the aggregate impact across all policies in the profile before activation. This enables safe preview of what a profile upgrade would do to an existing deployment.

## 4. Policy Providers

### 4.1 The Fifth Provider Type

A **Policy Provider** is a fifth DCM provider type — an external authoritative source that supplies policies directly into DCM or evaluates and enriches DCM data through an external logic engine.

| Type | Purpose | DCM Owns Result? |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Service Provider** | Realizes resources | Yes |
| **Information Provider** | Serves authoritative external data | No |
| **Meta Provider** | Composes multiple providers | Yes |
| **Storage Provider** | Persists DCM state | Yes |
| **Policy Provider** | Supplies policies from external authoritative sources, or evaluates and enriches data via external logic | Policies and enrichment data become DCM-owned on import |

**Why Policy Providers?** Organizations should not need to manually translate regulatory controls, security benchmarks, or vendor-specific policies into DCM format. A Policy Provider is the authoritative source — DCM subscribes to it and receives updates automatically. For Mode 4, the external system is the authoritative logic engine — DCM queries it and acts on the result.

### 4.2 The Four Policy Provider Delivery Modes

| Mode | Name | How it works | Logic lives in |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Mode 1** | DCM Native Push/Pull | Provider delivers DCM-format policy artifacts | DCM Policy Engine |
| **Mode 2** | OPA/Rego Bundle | Provider delivers OPA Rego bundles | DCM Policy Engine (OPA) |
| **Mode 3** | External Schema | Provider delivers external-format policies requiring naturalization | DCM Policy Engine (post-translation) |
| **Mode 4** | Black Box Query-Enrichment | DCM sends a query, provider evaluates and/or enriches, returns structured result | External provider — logic is opaque to DCM |

Modes 1-3 are **policy delivery** modes — the provider sends rules, DCM stores and executes them. Mode 4 is fundamentally different: the policy logic lives in the external system. DCM sends data, receives a result, and acts on it.

### 4.3 Policy Provider Contract — Modes 1-3

Policy Providers in Modes 1-3 follow the same base contract as all providers: registration, health check, trust, and provenance emission.

```yaml
policy_provider_registration:
  artifact_metadata:
    uuid: <uuid>
    handle: "providers/policy/grc-platform-001"
    version: "1.0.0"
    status: active
    owned_by:
      display_name: "Security Team"
      notification_endpoint: <endpoint>

  name: "Enterprise GRC Platform"
  description: "Publishes compliance controls from GRC platform to DCM"

  delivery:
    mode: <push | pull | webhook>
    pull_schedule: "0 2 * * *"    # cron — if mode: pull
    endpoint: <provider API endpoint>

  policy_format: <dcm_native | opa_rego | external_schema>

  managed_domains:
    concern_types: [compliance, sovereignty]
    concern_tags: [pci-dss, gdpr, iso-27001]

  trust_level: <trusted | verified | untrusted>
  max_policy_authority: gatekeeper

  on_update: proposed
  on_provider_failure:
    action: <deprecate | retain | alert>
    sunset_days: 30
```

### 4.4 Policy Naturalization (Mode 3)

When a Policy Provider delivers policies in an external format, DCM applies **Policy Naturalization** — translating external policy schemas into DCM policy format.

```
External Policy Format (OSCAL, XACML, CIS JSON, STIG XCCDF)
  │
  ▼  Policy Naturalization (translator component)
  │
  ▼
DCM Policy Format (standard DCM policy artifact)
  │
  ▼  Trust validation + conflict detection
  │
  ▼
DCM Policy Engine
```

```yaml
naturalization:
  source_schema: oscal           # oscal | xccdf | cis-json | xacml | custom
  translator_uuid: <uuid>
  validation_on_import: strict   # strict | lenient
```

### 4.5 Policy Provider and Policy Groups

A Modes 1-3 Policy Provider can deliver at three levels of granularity:

- **Individual policies** — administrator manually assigns to groups
- **Complete Policy Groups** — provider supplies group definitions alongside policies
- **Complete Policy Profiles** — provider supplies a full deployment profile for one-step activation

```yaml
policy_group:
  handle: "org/group/grc-pci-dss"
  source:
    type: policy_provider
    provider_uuid: <uuid>
    provider_group_reference: "pci-dss-v4-full"
    on_provider_update: proposed
    last_synced: <ISO 8601>
    provider_version: "4.0.1"
```

### 4.6 Trust Levels and Policy Authority

| Trust Level | Max Policy Authority | Requires | Use Case |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|---------|
| `trusted` | GateKeeper | Manual elevation + dual approval | Regulatory body, certified compliance package |
| `verified` | Validation | Registration + health check | Security vendor, GRC platform |
| `untrusted` | Advisory (logged but not executed) | Registration only | Evaluation, new providers |

Trust elevation requires explicit authorization from both a platform admin and a security owner.

### 4.7 Policy Provider Health and Lifecycle

- **Healthy** — policies current, delivery working normally
- **Degraded** — delivery delayed or partial — warnings emitted
- **Unhealthy** — policies move toward `deprecated` per `on_provider_failure` declaration
- **Deregistered** — policies deprecated with configured sunset

---

### 4.8 Mode 4 — Black Box Query-Enrichment

#### 4.8.1 Concept

A **Mode 4 Policy Provider** is an external system that DCM queries during the assembly process to evaluate request data, return a decision, enrich the payload with additional fields, or do both simultaneously.

**The key distinction from Modes 1-3:** The policy logic lives in the external system and is opaque to DCM. DCM does not receive or store the rules — it sends a query and receives a structured result. The external system is the authoritative evaluator and enricher.

**Mode 4 providers can:**
- **Evaluate** — return a pass/fail, score, or recommendation based on the query
- **Enrich** — inject additional fields into the payload (risk scores, compliance citations, cost predictions, organizational context, case references)
- **Do both** — evaluate and enrich in a single atomic query-response cycle

**Examples:**
- AI/ML risk scoring engine — returns risk score AND injects mitigation recommendations
- Compliance oracle — returns pass/fail AND injects compliance citations
- FinOps cost predictor — returns predicted cost AND injects cost allocation metadata
- Sovereignty verification service — returns jurisdiction compliance AND injects residency certificates
- Fraud detection system — returns anomaly score AND injects case reference number
- Identity enrichment service — returns authorization AND injects organizational context (business unit, cost center, project codes)
- Privileged access management system — returns allow/deny AND injects access justification record

#### 4.8.2 Governance Concerns

Mode 4 introduces governance concerns that Modes 1-3 do not:

**Data sovereignty on outbound data:** DCM is sending request payload data — potentially sensitive — to an external system. Before any data is sent, DCM must verify the provider is authorized to receive the data classifications present in the query. A sovereign deployment must prevent any data from leaving its boundary without explicit authorization.

**Result integrity:** The black box returns a result that DCM acts on. The logic is opaque — DCM cannot inspect it. The provenance chain must record the full query-response cycle: what was sent, what was returned, what action was taken, and the provider's audit token for cross-system correlation.

**Enrichment governance:** Fields injected by a Mode 4 provider carry the same provenance obligations as fields injected by a Transformation Policy. The override control model applies — a GateKeeper can refuse black box enrichment on sovereignty-sensitive fields. Enrichment output may itself carry classification implications and must be governed accordingly.

**Failure behavior:** The black box is external and can be unavailable, slow, or malformed. Failure behavior must be explicitly declared — the default is `gatekeep` (unknown is not safe).

**Non-determinism:** A Mode 4 provider may return different results for the same input at different times (e.g., a risk model updated overnight). Result caching must be declared — and cached results carry a validity period.

#### 4.8.3 Registration — Mode 4 Specific Fields

```yaml

  # A Mode 4 provider that enriches requires at minimum transformation authority
```

#### 4.8.4 Data Sovereignty Governance — Pre-Query Evaluation

Before DCM sends any data to a Mode 4 provider, the Policy Engine evaluates:

```
Query to Mode 4 provider proposed
  │
  ▼
Data classification check (BBQ-001)
  │  What classification levels are in the query payload fields?
  │  Is each field's classification ≤ provider's declared ceiling?
  │  → Any field exceeds ceiling: strip field or reject query
  │
  ▼
Sovereignty check (BBQ-003)
  │  Does the provider's operational_sovereignty.jurisdiction
  │  satisfy the requesting Tenant's sovereignty requirements?
  │  → Incompatible: block query, apply on_sovereign_mismatch behavior
  │
  ▼
Data minimization (BBQ-002)
  │  Strip all fields not in provider's data_request_spec
  │  Apply field-level filtering per cross_tenant_authorization if applicable
  │
  ▼
Authorized → send minimized query
Unauthorized → apply on_unavailable behavior (typically gatekeep)
```

#### 4.8.5 Assembly Process Integration

Mode 4 providers participate in any assembly phase — most usefully inside the placement loop where provider-specific data is available:

```yaml
policy:
  placement_phase: loop         # pre | loop | post | both
  evaluation_type: black_box_query
  black_box_provider_uuid: <uuid>

  # What to send — must be subset of provider's data_request_spec
  query_fields: [resource_type, placement.selected_provider_uuid, requester.tenant_uuid]

  # How to act on the decision component
  on_decision:
    pass: continue
    fail: <reject_candidate | gatekeep>
    score_below_threshold:
      threshold: 0.7
      action: reject_candidate   # try next provider candidate
    score_above_threshold:
      threshold: 0.9
      action: continue

  # How to act on the enrichment component
  on_enrichment:
    inject_fields: true          # inject returned fields into payload
    override_existing: false     # do not overwrite fields already set
    # Each injected field carries source_type: black_box_provider + audit_token
```

#### 4.8.6 Result Schema and Provenance

**Full result structure:**

```yaml
black_box_result:
  # Decision component (optional)
  decision:
    outcome: <pass | fail | score>
    score: 0.83
    confidence: <high | medium | low>
    citations:
      - "Provider certification ISO-27001 current as of 2026-01-15"
      - "No open security incidents in region eu-west-1a"
    valid_until: <ISO 8601>
    audit_token: "BB-2026-03-26-00847-A"  # provider's internal reference

  # Enrichment component (optional)
  enrichment:
    fields_to_inject:
      - field: risk_score
        value: 0.83
        provenance_note: "Returned by risk scoring engine v2.3"
      - field: risk_citations
        value: ["ISO-27001:A.12.1", "No active incidents"]
        provenance_note: "Risk scoring engine evidence"
      - field: recommended_mitigations
        value: ["Enable MFA", "Restrict egress to known endpoints"]
        provenance_note: "Risk scoring engine recommendations"
```

**Provenance on injected enrichment fields:**

Each field injected by a Mode 4 provider carries standard field-level provenance:

```yaml
risk_score:
  value: 0.83
  metadata:
    override: allow              # standard override control applies
    basis_for_value: "ML risk scoring engine evaluation"
  provenance:
    origin:
      source_type: black_box_provider
      source_uuid: <provider uuid>
      timestamp: <ISO 8601>
      audit_token: "BB-2026-03-26-00847-A"
      query_uuid: <uuid of this specific query-response cycle>
```

#### 4.8.7 Audit Record

Every Mode 4 query-response cycle produces a `black_box_evaluation_record` in the Audit Store regardless of outcome:

```yaml
black_box_evaluation_record:
  record_uuid: <uuid>
  policy_uuid: <uuid>
  request_uuid: <uuid>
  provider_uuid: <uuid>
  evaluated_at: <ISO 8601>
  placement_phase: loop

  query_sent:
    fields_included: [resource_type, placement.selected_provider_uuid]
    # Field NAMES only — not raw values. Values stored in provider's system.
    # Full correlation via audit_token.
    data_minimization_applied: true
    sovereignty_check: passed
    classification_ceiling_honored: true

  result_received:
    result_type: multi_factor
    decision:
      outcome: pass
      score: 0.83
      confidence: high
      valid_until: <ISO 8601>
      audit_token: "BB-2026-03-26-00847-A"
    enrichment:
      fields_injected: [risk_score, risk_citations, recommended_mitigations]
      override_existing_applied: false

  action_taken: continue_with_enrichment
  cached_result: false
  cache_stored: true
  cache_expires_at: <ISO 8601>
```

The `audit_token` is the **cross-system audit bridge** — DCM's record references the provider's internal record. Auditors can correlate DCM's audit trail with the black box provider's own logs for full end-to-end traceability.

#### 4.8.8 Failure and Fallback Behavior

| Condition | Default Behavior | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| `on_timeout` | `gatekeep` | Unknown is not safe |
| `on_error` | `gatekeep` | Malformed response is not safe |
| `on_unavailable` | `gatekeep` | External unavailability cannot bypass governance |
| `on_sovereign_mismatch` | `gatekeep` | Sovereignty cannot be bypassed |
| `on_classification_exceeded` | strip field or `gatekeep` | Data cannot be sent to unauthorized recipient |

All failure behaviors are configurable. `allow` is available for non-critical enrichment where the enrichment is additive and the request can proceed safely without it. Organizations must explicitly declare `allow` — it is never the default.

#### 4.8.9 System Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `BBQ-001` | Before sending any data to a Mode 4 provider, the Policy Engine must verify the provider is authorized to receive the data classification levels present in the query |
| `BBQ-002` | Data sent to a Mode 4 provider must be minimized to only the fields declared in the provider's `data_request_spec` |
| `BBQ-003` | A Mode 4 provider's `operational_sovereignty` must be compatible with the requesting Tenant's sovereignty requirements before any query is dispatched |
| `BBQ-004` | All Mode 4 query-response cycles must produce a `black_box_evaluation_record` in the Audit Store |
| `BBQ-005` | Mode 4 provider failure behavior (`on_timeout`, `on_error`, `on_unavailable`) must be explicitly declared — default is `gatekeep` |
| `BBQ-006` | Cached Mode 4 results must include the original query timestamp and validity period in provenance |
| `BBQ-007` | Fields injected into the payload by a Mode 4 provider enrichment must carry standard field-level provenance: `source_type: black_box_provider`, `source_uuid`, and `audit_token` |
| `BBQ-008` | The override control model applies to fields injected by Mode 4 enrichment — a GateKeeper policy may restrict or refuse black box enrichment on specific fields |
| `BBQ-009` | A Mode 4 provider that performs enrichment requires at minimum `transformation` trust level authority |

---

## 5. Lifecycle Time Constraints

### 5.1 Concept

Lifecycle time constraints declare **when a resource should cease to exist or trigger a lifecycle action**. They are a first-class field on any resource entity — not metadata, not a tag, but a governed field that follows the standard data model precedence and override control.

### 5.2 Constraint Types

| Type | Format | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `ttl` | ISO 8601 duration (e.g., `P14D`) | Relative — expires N time after the reference point |
| `expires_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp | Absolute — expires at a specific calendar date/time |

When both are declared, the **earliest expiry wins** (LTC-004).

### 5.3 Data Model

```yaml
lifecycle_constraints:
  ttl:
    duration: P14D                       # ISO 8601 duration — 14 days
    reference_point: realization_timestamp  # created_at | realization_timestamp | last_modified
    on_expiry: <destroy | suspend | notify | review>
    metadata:
      override: allow                    # standard override control applies
      basis_for_value: "Consumer declared ephemeral — 14-day lab resource"

  expires_at:
    timestamp: "2026-06-30T23:59:59Z"
    on_expiry: notify
    metadata:
      override: immutable
      locked_by_policy_uuid: <uuid>
      basis_for_value: "Project deadline — resource must not persist beyond Q2"

  # Enforcement behavior
  enforcement:
    warn_before_expiry: P1D              # warn 1 day before expiry
    warn_notification_endpoint: <from owned_by artifact metadata>
    grace_period: PT1H                  # 1 hour grace after expiry before action
    on_grace_period_expiry: <execute | escalate>
```

### 5.4 Precedence

Lifecycle time constraints follow the standard data model precedence chain:

```
Base Layer default (lowest — e.g., "no TTL by default")
  ↓
Core Layer (e.g., "all dev environment resources: TTL 90 days")
  ↓
Service Layer (e.g., "ephemeral compute: TTL 7 days")
  ↓
Request Layer (consumer declared TTL)
  ↓
Transformation Policy (enrich TTL from business context)
  ↓
GateKeeper Policy (highest — may lock TTL as immutable)
```

A consumer can declare `ttl: P14D` in their request. A GateKeeper policy can override this to `P7D` and lock it immutable if organizational policy mandates shorter maximum lifetimes. A Core Layer can set default TTLs for resource classes. The provenance chain records every modification.

### 5.5 Expiry Enforcement

The **Lifecycle Constraint Enforcer** is a DCM control plane component that:
- Monitors all realized entities against their declared lifecycle constraints
- Fires the configured `on_expiry` action when a constraint is reached
- Records the enforcement action in provenance and the Audit Store
- Emits expiry warnings `warn_before_expiry` duration before the deadline

Expiry enforcement is a DCM concern — not a provider concern. The provider does not need to know about or implement TTL logic.

### 5.6 System Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `LTC-001` | Lifecycle time constraints follow standard data model precedence — layers, request, policies |
| `LTC-002` | GateKeeper policies may lock lifecycle constraints as `override: immutable` or `immutable_ceiling: absolute` |
| `LTC-003` | Expiry enforcement is a DCM control plane function — not a provider concern |
| `LTC-004` | When multiple time constraints exist on an entity, the earliest expiry wins |
| `LTC-005` | Expired entities that fail to execute their `on_expiry` action enter `PENDING_EXPIRY_ACTION` state and trigger an escalation |

---

## 6. Cross-Tenancy Authorization Model

### 6.1 Default Stance — Closed

Cross-tenant information sharing is **closed by default**. No cross-tenant relationship of any nature is permitted unless explicitly authorized. This applies to both operational dependencies and informational relationships.

The hard tenancy spectrum:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `deny_all` | No cross-tenant relationships of any nature |
| `explicit_only` | All cross-tenant must be explicitly authorized (DEFAULT) |
| `operational_permitted` | Operational cross-tenant permitted; informational requires explicit auth |
| `allow_all` | All cross-tenant permitted — requires justification; not available in sovereign profile |

The default shifts from the Q59 model's `operational_only` to `explicit_only`. Informational sharing is no longer implicitly open — every informational cross-tenant relationship requires an explicit authorization record.

### 6.2 Cross-Tenant Authorization Record

```yaml
cross_tenant_authorization:
  artifact_metadata:
    uuid: <uuid>
    handle: "tenant-a/auth/shared-network-read"
    version: "1.0.0"
    status: active
    owned_by:
      display_name: "Infrastructure Tenant Admin"

  # WHO
  authorized_consumer_tenant_uuid: <uuid — or null for any_authorized_tenant>
  authorized_actor_constraint:
    roles: [service_account, automation]    # null = any actor in the tenant
    specific_uuids: []                      # specific actor UUIDs if needed

  # WHAT
  resource_entity_uuid: <specific entity — or null for type-level>
  resource_type_uuid: <if type-level authorization>
  permitted_fields:
    - field: network_segment
    - field: vlan_id
    # empty list = all fields permitted
  permitted_relationship_natures: [informational, operational]

  # WHEN
  valid_from: <ISO 8601>
  valid_until: <ISO 8601 — null = indefinite>

  # WHERE
  permitted_in_regions: [eu-west, eu-central]   # null = any region
  sovereignty_constraints:
    must_honor_consuming_tenant_sovereignty: true
    must_honor_owning_tenant_sovereignty: true

  # GOVERNANCE
  authorized_by_policy_uuid: <uuid>
  authorization_level: <tenant_global | resource_specific | field_specific>
  # Hierarchy: field_specific > resource_specific > tenant_global
  # More specific = higher precedence
```

### 6.3 Authorization Hierarchy

More specific authorizations take precedence over broader ones:

```
field_specific     ← highest precedence — only these exact fields on this entity
  │
resource_specific  ← this entity — all permitted fields
  │
tenant_global      ← all entities in this Tenant — broadest
```

If a tenant-global policy says "allow informational sharing with Tenant B" but a resource-specific policy says "this resource is not shareable with anyone," the resource-specific policy wins.

### 6.4 System Policies — Cross-Tenancy

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `XTA-001` | Cross-tenant information sharing is closed by default — explicit authorization required |
| `XTA-002` | Cross-tenant authorizations must specify who, what, when, and where |
| `XTA-003` | More specific authorizations take precedence: field_specific > resource_specific > tenant_global |
| `XTA-004` | All cross-tenant authorization decisions are policy-driven and DCM-enforced |
| `XTA-005` | Sovereignty constraints declared by either Tenant must be honored by all cross-tenant relationships |

---

## 7. Rehydration Tenancy Controls

### 7.1 Tenancy and Sovereignty Are Always Current

Tenancy controls, sovereignty directives, and cross-tenant authorizations are **always evaluated against current policies during rehydration**. They cannot be pinned to historical versions.

```yaml
rehydration:
  re_evaluate: true/false          # governs placement
  policy_version: current/pinned   # governs resource configuration policies
  # The following are ALWAYS current — cannot be pinned:
  tenancy_controls: always_current
  sovereignty_controls: always_current
  cross_tenant_authorizations: always_current
```

### 7.2 Rehydration Tenancy Conflict

When rehydration produces a tenancy or sovereignty constraint that conflicts with an existing cross-tenant allocation:

```yaml
rehydration_tenancy_conflict_record:
  rehydration_request_uuid: <uuid>
  entity_uuid: <uuid>
  conflict_type: cross_tenant_authorization_conflict
  original_authorization_uuid: <uuid>
  current_policy_violation:
    policy_uuid: <uuid>

### 7.3 System Policies — Rehydration

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `RHY-001` | Tenancy, sovereignty, and cross-tenant authorizations always use current policies during rehydration |
| `RHY-002` | Rehydration that conflicts with current tenancy/sovereignty pauses and enters PENDING_REVIEW |
| `RHY-003` | A paused rehydration allocation is not automatically released — requires explicit resolution |
| `RHY-004` | A policy may declare automatic resolution behavior for rehydration tenancy conflicts |

## 8. Open Questions

| # | Question | Impact | Status |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Should organizations be able to submit custom profiles and groups back to the DCM project registry? | Community | ✅ Resolved — community submissions via PR-based workflow; Tier 2; documented use case + deployment reference + test results + named maintainer (PROF-005) |
| 2 | Should there be a certified profile program — profiles that have been validated against specific regulatory frameworks? | Compliance | ✅ Resolved — certified profile program with third-party certification metadata; certified profiles promoted to Tier 1; applies to artifact not deployment (PROF-006) |
| 3 | Should Policy Provider trust elevation require a formal approval workflow in DCM UI or is out-of-band approval sufficient? | Security | ✅ Resolved — formal approval workflow; profile-governed approvers (1 standard → 3 sovereign); P7D shadow period; POLICY_PROVIDER_ELEVATED audit (PROF-007) |
| 4 | Should the default TTL for dev profile resources be configurable at the platform level or only at the group level? | Configuration | ✅ Resolved — overridable at platform domain layer; per-resource-type TTL overrides; on_expiry action configurable (PROF-008) |
| 5 | How does Policy Provider delivery interact with air-gapped deployments — pull from internal mirror? | Sovereignty | ✅ Resolved — signed bundle model identical to registry; Mode 4 in sovereign restricted to within-boundary endpoints (PROF-009) |

## 9. Related Concepts

- **Policy Engine** — executes the policies organized by groups and profiles
- **Policy Layers** — the assembly process step where policies execute
- **Artifact Metadata** — universal metadata on all policy artifacts
- **Five Artifact Statuses** — developing → proposed → active → deprecated → retired
- **Shadow Execution** — proposed policies and profiles run in shadow mode for validation
- **Override Control** — policies set override control on fields; immutable_ceiling: absolute for non-negotiables
- **Ingestion Model** — policy profile requirements may gate brownfield promotion
- **Four States** — rehydration tenancy controls govern how historical states are replayed


## 8. Policy Profile Gap Resolutions

### 8.1 Community Profile and Group Submissions (Q1)

Organizations may submit custom profiles and policy groups to the DCM community registry following the same PR-based proposal workflow as Resource Types. Community contributions live in Tier 2 (Verified Community).

```yaml
community_profile_submission:
  profile:
    handle: "community/profile/hipaa-openstack"
    extends: system/profile/hipaa-prod
    description: "HIPAA production profile for OpenStack deployments"
    policy_groups:
      - system/group/compliance-hipaa
      - community/group/openstack-security-baseline
    contributed_by: "Healthcare IT Community Group"
    tested_with: [OpenStack 2024.1, DCM 1.0]
  required_for_submission:
    - documented_use_case
    - at_least_one_real_deployment_reference
    - test_results_against_reference_implementation
    - named_maintainer
```

Community profiles carry the same lifecycle as Resource Types — shadow validation before active, deprecation policies, sunset periods. Organizations adopt them directly or extend them further.

### 8.2 Certified Profile Program (Q2)

DCM supports a certified profile program where profiles carry formal third-party certification metadata against compliance frameworks. Certified profiles are promoted to Tier 1 (DCM Core).

```yaml
profile_certification:
  certifications:
    - framework: HIPAA
      certifying_body: "Coalfire Systems"
      certification_date: "2025-11-01"
      valid_until: "2027-11-01"
      certification_scope: "PHI data lifecycle management via DCM"
      certificate_ref:
        credential_provider_uuid: <uuid>
        path: "dcm/registry/certifications/hipaa-prod-2025"
```

**Important:** Profile certification applies to the profile artifact only — it does not certify the deploying organization's compliance posture. A certified profile is evidence that the profile implements the required controls; it is not a compliance certification of any specific deployment.

### 8.3 Policy Provider Trust Elevation Approval (Q3)

Policy Provider trust elevation (increasing the mode level) requires a formal approval workflow. Approval requirements are profile-governed.

```yaml
policy_provider_trust_elevation:
  elevation_request:
    from_mode: 1
    to_mode: 3
    justification: "Need OPA Rego for complex placement constraints"

  approval_requirements:
    standard:
      approvers: [platform_admin]
      min_approvers: 1
    prod:
      approvers: [platform_admin, security_owner]
      min_approvers: 2
    fsi:
      approvers: [platform_admin, security_owner, compliance_officer]
      min_approvers: 2
      dual_approval_required: true
    sovereign:
      approvers: [platform_admin, security_owner, compliance_officer]
      min_approvers: 3
      requires_change_control_ticket: true

  shadow_period_after_elevation: P7D    # elevated mode runs in shadow before active
  audit_record: POLICY_PROVIDER_ELEVATED
```

The P7D shadow period catches unintended consequences before elevated outputs become binding on production requests.

### 8.4 Dev Profile Resource TTL Configurability (Q4)

The default TTL for dev profile resources is declared in the system domain layer and overridable at the platform domain level.

```yaml
layer:
  handle: "platform/dev-profile/resource-ttl-override"
  domain: platform
  fields:
    dev_profile_resource_ttl:
      default_ttl: P30D               # platform override: 30d instead of system default P7D
      max_ttl: P90D                   # consumers cannot declare TTL > 90 days in dev
      on_expiry: notify               # notify (consumers can extend) vs destroy
      per_resource_type_overrides:
        Compute.VirtualMachine: P7D
        Storage.Block: P14D
        DNS.Record: P3D
```

### 8.5 Air-Gapped Policy Provider Delivery (Q5)

Policy Provider delivery in air-gapped deployments uses signed bundles — same model as the registry bundle system.

```yaml
policy_provider_airgap:
  delivery_mode: signed_bundle
  bundle_contents:
    - provider_registration_yaml
    - policy_artifacts_zip
    - mode_specific_package:
        mode_3: opa_rego_bundle       # OPA Rego files + data
        mode_4: endpoint_config       # endpoint declaration (must be within boundary)
  signing_key_ref: <org-signing-key>
  valid_until: <ISO 8601>
```

**Mode 4 sovereign constraint:** In sovereign profiles, Mode 4 Policy Providers may only call endpoints within the sovereignty boundary. External AI service calls are blocked by the BBQ-001 sovereignty check before any Mode 4 query.

### 8.6 System Policies — Policy Profile Gaps

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `PROF-005` | Organizations may submit custom profiles and policy groups to the DCM community registry via the same PR-based proposal workflow as Resource Types. Community contributions live in Tier 2. Submissions require documented use case, at least one production deployment reference, test results, and a named maintainer. |
| `PROF-006` | DCM supports a certified profile program where profiles carry formal third-party certification metadata. Certified profiles are promoted to Tier 1. Profile certification applies to the artifact only — it does not certify the deploying organization's compliance posture. |
| `PROF-007` | Policy Provider trust elevation requires a formal approval workflow (standard: 1 platform admin; prod: platform admin + security owner; fsi/sovereign: dual approval + compliance officer). Elevated providers run in shadow mode for P7D before activation. All elevations produce a POLICY_PROVIDER_ELEVATED audit record. |
| `PROF-008` | The default TTL for dev profile resources is declared in the system domain layer and overridable at the platform domain level. Per-resource-type TTL overrides are supported. The on_expiry action is configurable. |
| `PROF-009` | Policy Provider delivery in air-gapped deployments uses signed bundles identical to the registry bundle model. Mode 4 providers in sovereign profiles may only call endpoints within the sovereignty boundary. |
