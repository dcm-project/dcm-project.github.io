> > **Design Priority:** Provider types implement all four design priorities simultaneously. Security properties (mTLS, scoped credentials, sovereignty declarations, accreditation) are present in all provider registrations. The capability extension model (Priority 3) enables new provider types without changing the base contract. See [Design Priorities](00-design-priorities.md).

## 1. The Unified Provider Contract

Every Provider in DCM — regardless of type — implements a single base contract. What varies between provider types is the **capability extension**: the specific operations exposed, the data that flows in each direction, and the typed schemas for that exchange.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                BASE PROVIDER CONTRACT                    │
│                                                          │
│  Registration · Health · Sovereignty · Accreditation    │
│  Governance Matrix · Zero Trust · Lifecycle              │

│  │                                                  │   │
│  │  What operations this provider type exposes.     │   │
│  │  What data flows in which direction.             │   │
│  │  What schemas govern the exchange.               │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Adding a new provider type** = implement the base contract + define a capability extension. No changes to the core required.

---

## 2. Base Contract — Registration

All providers register through the same pipeline. See [Registration Specification](../specifications/dcm-registration-spec.md) for the complete flow.

```yaml
provider_base_registration:
  # Standard artifact metadata
  artifact_metadata:
    uuid: <uuid>
    handle: "<tier>/<category>/<name>"    # e.g., "org/compute/eu-west-prod-1"
    version: "1.0.0"
    status: submitted                      # submitted → validating → active
    owned_by: { display_name: "<team>" }

  provider_type_id: <type>               # from Provider Type Registry
  display_name: "<human-readable name>"
  description: "<what this provider does>"

  # All providers declare these
  sovereignty_declaration:
    operating_jurisdictions: [<country_codes>]
    data_residency_zones: [<zone_ids>]
    sub_processors: []                   # third parties with data access

  accreditations:
    - accreditation_uuid: <uuid>         # reference to registered accreditation
      framework: <framework>
      status: active

  # Endpoints (which endpoints are required varies by type — see extensions)
  health_endpoint: "https://<provider>/health"

  # Zero trust identity
  certificate:
    pem: <provider-certificate>
    ca_chain: <ca-chain>
    rotation_interval: P90D
```

**Registration lifecycle states:**
```
SUBMITTED → VALIDATING → PENDING_APPROVAL → ACTIVE
                       ↘ REJECTED
ACTIVE → SUSPENDED | DEREGISTERING → DEREGISTERED | FORCED_DEREGISTERED
```

---

## 3. Base Contract — Health Check

Every provider implements a health endpoint. DCM calls it on the declared interval.

```
GET {health_endpoint}

Response 200:
{
  "status": "healthy | degraded | unhealthy",
  "version": "<provider version>",
  "capabilities_available": ["<list of currently available capabilities>"],
  "details": { }    # provider-specific; DCM treats as opaque
}
```

**DCM response to health states:**
- `healthy` → normal operations; next poll scheduled
- `degraded` → reduced routing preference; platform admin notified (medium urgency)
- `unhealthy` / no response → after `failure_threshold`: status → DEGRADED; new requests not routed
- After 2× `failure_threshold`: status → UNAVAILABLE; drift detection triggered on all hosted entities

---

## 4. Base Contract — Governance Matrix Enforcement

Every interaction with every provider is evaluated against the Governance Matrix before data crosses the boundary. This is not optional and not configurable per provider — it is a base contract requirement.

```
Outbound interaction (DCM → Provider):
  1. Classify all fields in the payload by data_classification
  2. Resolve provider's active accreditations
  3. Evaluate Governance Matrix: permitted | strip_field | deny | redact
  4. Apply field permissions
  5. Audit record written (regardless of outcome)
  6. If DENY: interaction blocked; entity enters PENDING_REVIEW if appropriate

Inbound interaction (Provider → DCM):
  1. Authenticate provider identity (mTLS)
  2. Verify credential scope matches the operation
  3. Accept payload; apply data_classification tags
  4. Store in appropriate store per data_classification
```

---

## 5. Base Contract — Zero Trust

All provider interactions operate under the active zero trust posture. Minimum requirement for all providers at all profiles:

- Mutual TLS authentication on every call (both sides present certificates)
- Scoped, short-lived interaction credentials (not long-lived API keys)
- Every call authenticated; no implicit trust from network position or prior calls
- Certificate rotation on declared interval

Higher profiles add: certificate pinning, per-message signing, hardware attestation.

---

## 6. Base Contract — Provider Lifecycle Events

Providers must report state changes via lifecycle events. This is a base contract obligation — not optional:

```json
POST {dcm_lifecycle_endpoint}
{
  "event_uuid": "<uuid>",
  "event_type": "<event_type>",
  "provider_uuid": "<uuid>",
  "affected_entity_uuids": ["<uuid>"],
  "event_timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "severity": "INFO | WARNING | CRITICAL"
}
```

---

## 7. Capability Extensions — All Eleven Types

### 7.1 Service Provider

**What it does:** Realizes infrastructure resources. Receives assembled payloads, provisions the resource, returns realized state.

**Additional endpoints:**
```
POST {dispatch_endpoint}         # receive and execute dispatch payload
POST {cancel_endpoint}           # receive cancellation request (if supported)
POST {discover_endpoint}         # receive discovery request; return discovered state
```

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
service_provider_capabilities:
  resource_types:
    - fqn: Compute.VirtualMachine
      spec_version: "2.1.0"
      catalog_item_uuid: <uuid>
  cancellation:
    supports_cancellation: true
    cancellation_supported_during: [DISPATCHED, PROVISIONING]
  discovery:
    supports_discovery: true
    discovery_method: api_query | passive_event | hybrid
  naturalization:
    target_format: openstack_nova | vmware_vsphere | custom
  cost_metadata:
    opex_per_unit_per_hour: 0.28
    currency: USD
```

**Data direction:** DCM sends assembled Requested State → Provider naturalizes → executes → denaturalizes → returns Realized State. DCM writes Realized State to Snapshot Store.

---

### 7.2 Information Provider

**What it does:** Serves authoritative external data to enrich DCM's understanding of resources and business context.

**Additional endpoints:**
```
POST {query_endpoint}            # receive query; return data in DCM unified format
POST {write_back_endpoint}       # optional; receive DCM updates to push to source system
```

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
information_provider_capabilities:
  data_domains:
    - domain: business_data
      data_types: [business_unit, cost_center, product_owner]
      authority_level: primary | secondary | supplementary
  query_capacity:
    max_queries_per_second: 100
  confidence_model:
    data_freshness_sla: PT1H
  write_back_supported: false
```

**Data direction:** DCM sends lookup query → Provider returns data in DCM format → DCM enriches entity fields.

---

### 7.3 Storage Provider

**What it does:** Persists DCM state data. Implements one or more store contracts (GitOps, write-once snapshot, event stream, search index, audit).

**Additional endpoints:**
```
POST {write_endpoint}            # receive and persist data
GET  {read_endpoint}             # return stored data
POST {query_endpoint}            # execute indexed query (search index sub-type)
GET  {health_endpoint}           # includes store-specific metrics
```

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
storage_provider_capabilities:
  store_types:
    - gitops               # Intent and Requested stores
    - write_once_snapshot  # Realized store
    - event_stream         # Discovered store
    - search_index         # Query projection
    - audit                # Audit store
  consistency: strong | eventual | bounded_staleness
  geo_replicated: true
  encryption_at_rest: AES-256
  hsm_backed: false
```

**Data direction:** Bidirectional. DCM writes state; DCM reads state. Provider never initiates.

---

### 7.4 Meta Provider

**What it does:** Composes multiple child providers to deliver a compound service as a single catalog item. The Meta Provider declares a compound service definition — constituent resource types, dependencies, and delivery requirements — so DCM can place, sequence, and govern the constituents. For its own resource types (`provided_by: self`), the Meta Provider executes as a standard Service Provider. All orchestration, placement, sequencing, failure handling, and compensation is performed by DCM using the declared dependency graph.

> **Full specification:** See [Meta Provider Composability Model](30-meta-provider-model.md) for the complete orchestration contract, four-state model, failure propagation, compensation, and system policies (MPX-001–MPX-008).

**Capability declaration extension (summary — full schema in doc 30):**
```yaml
meta_provider_capabilities:
  constituent_provider_types: [service_provider, information_provider, meta_provider]
  composition_model:
    execution: dependency_ordered    # sequential | parallel | dependency_ordered
    max_concurrent_realizations: 10
    max_constituent_count: 20
    max_nesting_depth: 3
  partial_delivery_supported: true
  compensation_supported: true      # required if partial_delivery_supported: true (MPX-001)
  compensation_timeout: PT30M
  idempotency_guaranteed: true
  status_reporting:
    supported: true
    interval: PT30S
  resource_types_composed:
    - fqn: ApplicationStack.WebApp
      version: "2.0.0"
      constituents:
        - resource_type: Compute.VirtualMachine
          required_for_delivery: required
        - resource_type: Network.IPAddress
          required_for_delivery: required
        - resource_type: DNS.Record
          required_for_delivery: partial
      composition_visibility: selective   # opaque | transparent | selective
```

**Composite status determination:**
- `REALIZED` — all required constituents succeeded
- `DEGRADED` — required constituents succeeded; one or more partial constituents failed (accepted if `partial_delivery_supported: true`)
- `FAILED` — one or more required constituents failed → compensation executes

**Data direction:** DCM sends fully assembled compound payload → Meta Provider orchestrates constituents in dependency order → aggregates realized states → returns compound realized state to DCM.

---

### 7.5 Policy Provider

**What it does:** Evaluates policies externally. Receives a DCM payload, evaluates Rego or custom logic, returns a typed policy decision.

**Additional endpoints:**
```
POST {evaluate_endpoint}         # receive payload; return policy decision
POST {test_endpoint}             # receive test case; return evaluation result (shadow mode)
```

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
policy_provider_capabilities:
  mode: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
  policy_types: [gatekeeper, validation, transformation, recovery]
  framework: opa | cedar | custom
  shadow_mode_supported: true
  endpoint_sovereignty_zone: <zone_id>   # required for Mode 4
```

**Data direction:** DCM sends payload + active policy bundle → Provider evaluates → returns typed decision (allow/deny, mutations, action).

---

### 7.6 Credential Provider

**What it does:** Issues, rotates, and revokes credentials used within the DCM ecosystem — both DCM interaction credentials (short-lived, scoped, used for provider dispatch under the Zero Trust model) and consumer-facing resource credentials (SSH keys, API keys, kubeconfigs, service account tokens, database passwords, x509 certificates).

> **Full specification:** See [Credential Provider Model](31-credential-provider-model.md) for the complete issuance contract, rotation protocol, revocation propagation, consumer delivery, and system policies (CPX-001–CPX-008).

**Credential values are never stored in DCM** — only credential metadata (UUID, type, scope, expiry, status) is stored. Values are held by the Credential Provider and retrieved by authorized consumers via a declared `value_retrieval_endpoint`.

**Additional endpoints:**
```
POST   {issue_endpoint}              # issue credential; return metadata + retrieval URL
POST   {rotate_endpoint}             # rotate; return old/new UUIDs + transition window
DELETE {revoke_endpoint}/{uuid}      # revoke immediately or at transition window end
POST   {validate_endpoint}           # use-time validity check (scope, revocation, expiry)
GET    {list_endpoint}               # list credentials by entity_uuid or issued_to
```

**Capability declaration extension (summary — full schema in doc 31):**
```yaml
credential_provider_capabilities:
  credential_types:
    - api_key
    - x509_certificate
    - ssh_key
    - service_account_token
    - database_password
    - kubeconfig
    - hsm_backed_key
    - dcm_interaction          # required if handling DCM interaction credentials
  hsm_backed: false
  fips_140_2_level: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3   # enforced per profile (Section 12)
  dynamic_secrets: true
  rotation_support: true
  revocation_sla: PT5M         # profile-governed; PT30S for sovereign
  approved_algorithms:         # declare which algorithms the provider supports
    ssh_key: [Ed25519, ECDSA-P-384, RSA-4096]
    x509_certificate: [Ed25519, ECDSA-P-384, RSA-4096]
    service_account_token: [RS256, ES256, HS256]
    # ... per credential type
  key_escrow:
    supported: false           # true only for regulated sovereign deployments
```

**Data direction:** DCM requests credential → Provider issues scoped credential + returns metadata → DCM stores metadata, includes retrieval URL in realized entity → Consumer retrieves value via authenticated endpoint. Revocation: DCM requests revocation → Provider invalidates → DCM publishes revocation event to Message Bus → all components refresh revocation cache within profile-governed TTL.

---

### 7.7 Auth Provider

**What it does:** Authenticates actor identities and resolves their roles and group memberships.

**Additional endpoints:**
```
POST {authenticate_endpoint}     # receive credentials; return auth token + claims
POST {authorize_endpoint}        # receive token + operation; return allow/deny
GET  {identity_endpoint}         # return actor claims for a token
```

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
auth_provider_capabilities:
  authentication_modes: [oidc, ldap, saml, mtls, hardware_token]
  mfa_methods: [totp, push_notification, hardware_token]
  rbac_model: flat | hierarchical | abac
  step_up_supported: true
  token_lifetime:
    default: PT1H
    max: PT8H
```

**Data direction:** Consumer sends credentials → Auth Provider validates → returns token + claims → DCM extracts actor identity.

---

### 7.8 Notification Provider

**What it does:** Receives unified notification envelopes from DCM and delivers them via configured channels.

**Additional endpoints:**
```
POST {delivery_endpoint}         # receive notification envelope; deliver to channel
POST {delivery_status_endpoint}  # callback: report delivery status to DCM
```

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
notification_provider_capabilities:
  delivery_channels:
    - channel_type: slack | pagerduty | email | webhook | sms | servicenow
      supports_urgency_routing: true
      config_schema_ref: <uuid>
  delivery_guarantees:
    at_least_once: true
    idempotency_key: notification_uuid
    max_latency_seconds: 30
  sovereignty_aware_delivery: true
```

**Data direction:** DCM sends notification envelope → Provider translates to channel format → delivers → reports status.

---

### 7.9 Message Bus Provider

**What it does:** Provides persistent, high-throughput asynchronous event streaming between DCM components and external systems.

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
message_bus_capabilities:
  protocols: [kafka, amqp, mqtt]
  persistence: true
  durability: at_least_once | exactly_once
  external_endpoints: false          # true only if messages leave sovereignty boundary
  topics:
    - name: dcm.events
      retention: P7D
```

**Data direction:** Bidirectional publish/subscribe. DCM publishes events; components and external systems subscribe.

---

### 7.10 Registry Provider

**What it does:** Serves the Resource Type Registry — the authoritative catalog of resource types available to DCM deployments.

**Additional endpoints:**
```
GET  {registry_endpoint}         # serve registry entries (full or incremental)
GET  {bundle_endpoint}           # serve signed registry bundle (air-gapped mode)
```

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
registry_provider_capabilities:
  serves_tiers: [core, verified_community, organization]
  incremental_sync: true
  signed_bundles: true           # for air-gapped deployments
  bundle_signing_key_ref: <uuid>
```

**Data direction:** DCM pulls registry entries → Provider returns signed bundle or live entries.

---

### 7.11 Peer DCM (Federation)

**What it does:** Another DCM instance participating in federation. Treated as a typed Provider with a federation tunnel as the communication channel.

**Capability declaration extension:**
```yaml
peer_dcm_capabilities:
  dcm_version: "1.0.0"
  tunnel_type: peer | parent_child | hub_spoke
  deployment_accreditations: [<accreditation_uuids>]
  inbound_authorization:          # what this peer may request from local DCM
    - operation: catalog_query
      resource_types: [Compute.VirtualMachine]
  outbound_authorization:         # what local DCM may request from this peer
    - operation: placement_query
      resource_types: [Compute.VirtualMachine]
  data_boundary:
    max_classification: restricted
  trust_posture: verified | vouched | provisional
```

**Data direction:** Bidirectional within declared authorization scope. Federation tunnel with mTLS, certificate pinning, per-message signing.

---

## 8. Provider Type Registry

The Provider Type Registry is the authoritative list of provider types that a DCM deployment accepts registrations for. It follows the three-tier registry model (Core / Verified Community / Organization).

```yaml
provider_type_registry_entry:
  provider_type_id: service_provider
  tier: core
  default_approval_method: reviewed   # auto | reviewed | verified | authorized
  enabled_in_profiles: [minimal, dev, standard, prod, fsi, sovereign]
  capability_extension_schema_ref: <uuid>
```

Profile-governed approval methods override provider type defaults. See [Registration Specification](../specifications/dcm-registration-spec.md) Section 3 for the complete approval method resolution model.

---

## 9. Related Policies

| Policy | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `PRV-001` | All providers implement the base contract. No provider is exempt from registration, health check, sovereignty declaration, governance matrix enforcement, or zero trust authentication. |
| `PRV-002` | Governance Matrix evaluation occurs before every provider interaction. It is not configurable per provider and cannot be bypassed. |
| `PRV-003` | Provider capability declarations are verified at registration. Capabilities not declared at registration cannot be invoked after activation. |
| `PRV-004` | Peer DCM instances are treated as typed providers. Federation is the Provider abstraction applied across DCM instances — not a separate abstraction. |
| `PRV-005` | Adding a new provider type requires implementing the base contract and defining a capability extension. No changes to DCM core are required. |
